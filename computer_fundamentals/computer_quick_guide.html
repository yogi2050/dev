</ul>
<h1>Computer - Memory</h1>
<p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instruction. Computer memory is the storage space in computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.</p>
<p>The memory is divided into large number of small parts. Each part is called cell. Each location or cell has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one.</p>
<p>For example if computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024=65536 memory location. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>Memory is primarily of three types</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Cache Memory</p></li>
<li><p>Primary Memory/Main Memory</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary Memory</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Computer - RAM</h1>
<p>A RAM constitutes the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program and program result. It is read/write memory. It is called random access memory (RAM).</p>
<p>Since access time in RAM is independent of the address to the word that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other location & takes the same amount of time. We can reach into the memory at random & extremely fast but can also be quite expensive.</p> 
<p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence a backup uninterruptible power system(UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small , both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p> 
<p>RAM is of two types</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Static RAM (SRAM)</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/primary_memory.html" alt="Primary Memory" />
<h1>Computer - ROM</h1>
<p>ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture.</p>
<p>A ROM, stores such instruction as are required to start computer when electricity is first turned on, this operation is referred to as bootstrap. ROM chip are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p>
<img src="images/rom.html" alt="ROM"/>
<h1>Computer - Motherboard</h1>
<p>The motherboard serves as a single platform to connect all of the parts of a computer together. A motherboard connects CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card and other ports and expansion cards directly or via cables. It can be considered as the backbone of a computer.</p>
<p><img src="images/mother_board.html" alt="Mother Board" /></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Motherboard varies greatly in supporting various types of components.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally a motherboard supports a single type of CPU and few types of memories.</p></li>
<li><p>Video Cards, Hard disks, Sound Cards have to compatible with motherboard to function properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Motherboards, cases and power supplies must be compatible to work properly together.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Computer - Memory Units</h1>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit.</p></li>
<li><p>The storage capacity are expressed in terms of Bytes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following are the main memory storage units:</p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:10%">Sr. No.</th><th style="width:20%">Unit</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Bit (Binary Digit)</td><td>A binary digit is logical 0 &amp; 1 representing a passive or an active state of a component in an electric circuit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Nibble</td><td>A group of 4 bits is called nibble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Byte</td><td>A group of 8 bits is called byte. A byte is the smallest unit which can represent a data item or a character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Word</td><td>A computer word like a byte, is a group of fixed number of bits processed as a unit which varies from computer but is fixed for each computer. <br/>The length of a computer word is called word-size or word length and it may be as small as 8 bits or may be as long as 96 bits. <br/>A computer stores the information in the form of the computer words.</td></tr>
</table>
<h1>Computer - Ports</h1>
<ul class="list" >
<li><p>A computer port is a physical docking point using which an extenal device can be connected to the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>A computer port can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to computer or over the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<ul class="list" >
<li><p>External devices are connected to a computer using cables and ports.</p></li>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>System Software</p></li>
<li><p>Application Software</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>System Software</h2>
<p>The system software is collection of programs designed to operate, control and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. System software are generally prepared by computer manufactures.</p>
<p>These softwares comprise of programs written in low level languages which interact with the hardware at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between hardware and the end users.</p>
<p>Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter, Assemblers etc.</p>
<img class="src" src="images/system_software.html" alt="System Software" />
<h2>Application Software</h2>
<p>Application software are the software that are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software prepared by us in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software.</p>
<p>Application software may consists of a single program, such as a Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing simple text. It may also consists of a collection of programs, often called a software package, which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package.</p>

<h1>Computer - Operating System</h1>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the software and the computer hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an integration set of specialised programs that are used to manage overall resources and operations of the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>It is specialised software that controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, including application programs and other system software.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Objectives of Operating System</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Making a computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner</p></li>
<li><p>To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users</p></li>
<li><p>To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system.</p></li>
<li><p>To act as an intermediary between the hardware and its users and making it easier for the users to access and use other resources.</p></li>

<li><p>IP Address is a unique set of numbers (such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies a computer location.</p></li>
<li><p>A special computer DNS (Domain Name Server) is used to give name to the IP Address so that user can locate a computer by a name.</p></li>
<li><p>For Example, a DNS server will resolve a name <b>http://www.tutorialspoint.com</b> to a particular IP address to unique identify the computer on which this website is hosted.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet is accessible to every user all over the world.</p></li>
</ul>
