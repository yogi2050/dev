[IEEE Std 610.1990] </p>
<p><b>CMMI Model:</b> Since the CMMI Framework can generate different models based on the needs of the organization using it, there are multiple CMMI models. Consequently, the phrase "CMMI MODEL" could be any one of many collections of information. The phrase "CMMI models" refers to one, some, or the entire collection of possible models that can be generated from the CMMI Framework.</p>

<p><b>Derived measures:</b> Data resulting from the mathematical function of two or more base measures.</p>
<p><b>Derived requirements:</b> Requirements that are not explicitly stated in the customer requirements, but are inferred (1) from contextual requirements (e.g., applicable standards, laws, policies, common practices, and management decisions), or (2) from requirements needed to specify a product component. Derived requirements can also arise during analysis and design of components of the product or system.</p>
<p><b>Design review:</b> A formal, documented, comprehensive, and systematic examination of a design to evaluate the design requirements and the capability of the design to meet these requirements, and to identify problems and propose solutions.</p>
<p><b>Development:</b> Development, as it is used throughout CMMI, implies maintenance activities as well as development activities. Experience has shown that best practices should be applied to both development and maintenance projects if an organization is in pursuit of engineering excellence.</p>
<p><b>Developmental plan:</b> A plan for guiding, implementing, and controlling the design and development of one or more products.</p>
<p><b>Directing implementation:</b> A common feature of CMMI model process areas with a staged representation that groups the generic practices related to managing the performance of the process, managing the integrity of its work products, and involving relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Discipline amplification:</b> Model components that provide guidance for interpreting model information for specific disciplines (e.g., systems engineering, or software engineering) are called "DISCIPLINE AMPLIFICATIONS." Discipline amplifications are added to other model components where necessary. These are easy to locate because they appear on the right side of the page and have a title indicating the discipline that they address (for example, "For Software Engineering").</p>
<p><b>Document:</b> A document is a collection of data, regardless of the medium on which it is recorded. It generally has permanence and can be read by humans or machines. Documents include both paper and electronic documents.</p>
<a name="E"></a>

<p><b>Entry criteria:</b> States of being that must be present before an effort can begin successfully.</p>
<p><b>Equivalent staging:</b> Equivalent staging is a target staging, created using the continuous representation that is defined so that the results of using the target staging can be compared to the maturity levels of the staged representation.</p>
<p><b>Exit criteria:</b> States of being that must be present before an effort can end successfully.</p>
<p><b>Expected CMMI components:</b> CMMI components that explain what may be done to satisfy a required CMMI component. Model users can implement the expected components explicitly or implement equivalent alternative practices to these components. Specific and generic practices are expected model components</p>
<a name="F"></a>

<p><b>Formal evaluation process:</b> In the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area, see the definition of a "formal evaluation process" in the introductory notes.</p>
<p><b>Functional analysis:</b> Examination of a defined function to identify all the subfunctions necessary to the accomplishment of that function; identification of functional relationships and interfaces (internal and external) and capturing these in a functional architecture; and flow down of upper level performance requirements and assignment of these requirements to lower level subfunctions. </p>
<p><b>Functional architecture:</b> The hierarchical arrangement of functions, their internal and external (external to the aggregation itself) functional interfaces and external physical interfaces, their respective functional and performance requirements, and their design constraints.</p>
<a name="G"></a>
<p><b>Generic goal:</b> GENERIC GOALS are called "generic" because the same goal statement appears in multiple process areas. In the staged representation, each process area has only one generic goal. Achievement of a generic goal in a process area signifies improved control in planning and implementing the processes associated with that process area, thus indicating whether these processes are likely to be effective, repeatable, and lasting. Generic goals are required model components and are used in appraisals to determine whether a process area is satisfied.</p>
<p><b>Generic practice:</b> GENERIC PRACTICES provide institutionalization to ensure that the processes associated with the process area will be effective, repeatable, and lasting. Generic practices are categorized by generic goals and common features and are expected components in CMMI models. (Only the generic practice title, statement, and elaborations appear in the process areas.)</p>
<p><b>Generic practice elaboration:</b> After the specific practices, the generic practice titles and statements appear that apply to the process area. After each generic practice statement, an elaboration may appear in plain text with the heading "Elaboration". The GENERIC PRACTICE ELABORATION provides information about how the generic practice should be interpreted for the process area. If there is no elaboration present, the application of the generic practice is obvious without an elaboration.</p>
<p><b>Goal:</b> A "GOAL" is a required CMMI component that can be either a generic goal or a specific goal. When you see the word "goal" in a CMMI model, it always refers to model components (for example, generic goal, specific goal).</p>
<a name="H"></a>
<p><b>Incomplete process:</b> A process that is not performed or is only performed partially (also known as capability level 0). One or more of the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied.</p>
<p><b>Independent group:</b> In the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area, see the discussion of a "group that is independent" in the introductory notes.</p>
<p><b>Informative CMMI components:</b> CMMI components that help model users understand the required and expected components of a model. These components may contain examples, detailed explanations, or other helpful information. Subpractices, notes, references, goal titles, practice titles, sources, typical work products, discipline amplifications, and generic practice elaborations are informative model components.</p>
<p><b>Institutionalization:</b> The ingrained way of doing business that an organization follows routinely as part of its corporate culture.</p>
<p><b>Integrated Product and Process Development:</b> A systematic approach to product development that achieves a timely collaboration of relevant stakeholders throughout the product life cycle to better satisfy customer needs.</p>
<p><b>Integrated team:</b> A group of people with complementary skills and expertise who are committed to delivering specified work products in timely collaboration. Integrated team members provide skills and advocacy appropriate to all phases of the work products. life and are collectively responsible for delivering the work products as specified. An integrated team should include empowered representatives from organizations, disciplines, and functions that have a stake in the success of the work products.</p>
<p><b>Interface control:</b> In configuration management, the process of (1) identifying all functional and physical characteristics relevant to the interfacing of two or more configuration items provided by one or more organizations, and (2) ensuring that the proposed changes to these characteristics are evaluated and approved prior to implementation. [IEEE 828-1983].</p>

<a name="M"></a>
<p><b>Manager:</b> A project manager is the person responsible for planning, directing, controlling,structuring, and motivating the project. He or she may provide both technical and administrative direction and control to those performing project tasks or activities within his or her area of responsibility. The project manager is ultimately responsible to the customer.</p>
<p><b>Maturity level:</b> Degree of process improvement across a predefined set of process areas in which all goals within the set are attained. </p>
<p><b>Memorandum of agreement:</b> Binding documents of understanding or agreements between two or more parties.</p>
<a name="N"></a>
<p><b>Natural bounds:</b> The inherent process reflected by measures of process performance, sometimes referred to as "voice of the process." Techniques such as control charts, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals are used to determine whether the variation is due to common causes (i.e., the process is predictable or "stable") or is due to some special cause that can and should be identified and removed.</p>
<p><b>Non-developmental item:</b> An item of supply that was developed previous to its current use in an acquisition or development process. Such an item may require minor modifications to meet the requirements of its current intended use.</p>
<p><b>Nontechnical requirements:</b> Contractual provisions, commitments, conditions, and terms that affect how products or services are to be acquired. Examples include products to be delivered, data rights for delivered commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental items (NDIs), delivery dates, and milestones with exit criteria. Other nontechnical requirements include training requirements, site requirements, and deployment schedules.</p>
<a name="O"></a>
<p><b>Objective:</b> The term objective is used in CMMI in the common everyday sense; this is our objective or goal to be accomplished.</p>
<p><b>Objective evidence:</b> As used in CMMI appraisal materials, qualitative or quantitative information, records, or statements of fact pertaining to the characteristics of an item or service or to the existence and implementation of a process element, which are based on observation, measurement, or test and which are verifiable.</p>
<p><b>Objectively evaluate:</b> To review activities and work products against criteria that minimize subjectivity and bias by the reviewer. An example of an objective evaluation is an audit against requirements, standards, or procedures by an independent quality assurance function.</p>
<p><b>Observation:</b> As used in CMMI appraisal materials, a written record that represents the appraisal team members. understanding of information either seen or heard during the appraisal data collection activities. The written record may take the form of a statement or may take alternative forms as long as the information content is preserved.</p>

<p><b>Operational scenario:</b> A description of an imagined sequence of events that includes the interaction of the product with its environment and users, as well as interaction among its product components. Operational scenarios are used to evaluate the requirements and design of the system and to verify and validate the system.</p>
<p><b>Optimizing process:</b> A quantitatively managed process that is improved based on an understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in the process. A process that focuses on continually improving the range of process performance through both incremental and innovative improvements.</p>
