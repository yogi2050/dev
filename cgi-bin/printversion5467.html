<p>Validation is checking something against a rule. When you are beginners, this is very common that you will do many mistakes in writing your CSS rules. How you will make sure whatever you have written is 100% accurate and upto the W3 quality standards.</p>
<p>If you use CSS your code needs to be correct. Improper code may cause unexpected results in how your page looks or functions.</p>
<p>But if you want to validate your CSS style sheet embedded in an (X)HTML document, you should first check that the (X)HTML you use is valid.  </p>
<p>Tool to check the validity  of (X)HTML document: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">Validate (X)HTML document</a>.</p>
<p>There are following good tools to check the validity of your CSS.</p>

There are a few validators which will also tell you which CSS features are supported by which browsers (since not all browsers are equal in their CSS implementation).</p>
<h1>Why Validate Your HTML Code?</h1>
<p>There are a number of reasons why you should validate your code. But major ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It Helps Cross-Browser, Cross-Platform and Future Compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase Search Engine Visibility because you have good quality website.</p></li>
<li><p>Professionalism: As a web developer your code should not raise errors while seen by the visitors.</p></li>
</ul>
