<h1>What is JavaScript ?</h1>
<p>JavaScript started life as LiveScript, but Netscape changed the name, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.to JavaScript. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with a name <i>LiveScript</i>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.</p>
<p>The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html" target="_blank">ECMA-262 Specification</a> defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>
<p>JavaScript is:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language</li>
<li>Designed for creating network-centric applications</li>
<li>Complementary to and integrated with Java</li>
<li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML</li>
<li>Open and cross-platform</li>
</ul>
<h1>Client-side JavaScript:</h1>
<p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.</p>
<p>It means that a web page need no longer be static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.</p>
<p>The JavaScript client-side mechanism features many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.</p>
<p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid they would be submitted to the Web Server.</p>
<p>JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user explicitly or implicitly initiates.</p>
<h1>Advantages of JavaScript:</h1>
<p>The merits of using JavaScript are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Less server interaction:</b> You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Immediate feedback to the visitors:</b> They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Increased interactivity:</b> You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Richer interfaces:</b> You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Limitations with JavaScript:</h1>
<p>We can not treat JavaScript as a full fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript can not be used for Networking applications because there is no such support available.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocess capabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.</p>
<h1>JavaScript Development Tools:</h1>
<p>One of JavaScript's strengths is that expensive development tools are not usually required. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad.</p>
<p>Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.</p>
<p>To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Few of them are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Microsoft FrontPage:</b> Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web
developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of an interactive web site.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX:</b> Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional
web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Macromedia HomeSite 5:</b> This provided a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor, which will manage their personal web site just fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Where JavaScript is Today ?</h1>
<p>The ECMAScript Edition 4 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 4 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.</p>
<p>The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ecmascript.org/</a></p>
<p>Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although each language still supports features that are not part of the standard.</p>
