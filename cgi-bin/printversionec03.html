<p>A constant is a name or an identifier for a simple value. A constant value cannot change during the execution of the script. By default a constant is case-sensitiv. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase. A constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. If you have defined a constant, it can never be changed or undefined. </p>
<p>To define a constant you have to use define() function and to retrieve the value of a constant, you have to simply specifying its name. Unlike with variables, you do not need to have a constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() to read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name dynamically.</p>
<h2>constant() function: </h2>
<p>As indicated by the name, this function will return the value of the constant.</p>
<p>This is useful when you want to retrieve value of a constant, but you do not know its name, i.e. It is stored in a variable or returned by a function.</p>
<h2>constant() example:</h2>
<table cellpadding="5" class="src"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;?php

define("MINSIZE", 50);

echo MINSIZE;
echo constant("MINSIZE"); // same thing as the previous line

?&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Only scalar data (boolean, integer, float and string) can be contained in constants.</p>
<h2>Differences between constants and variables are: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p>	There is no need to write a dollar sign ($) before a constant, where as in Variable one has to write a dollar sign.</p></li>
<li><p>	Constants cannot be defined by simple assignment, they may only be defined using the define() function.</p></li>
<li><p>	Constants may be defined and accessed anywhere without regard to variable scoping rules.</p></li>
<li><p>	Once the Constants have been set, may not be redefined or undefined.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Valid and invalid constant names:</h2>
<table cellpadding="5" class="src"><tr><td><pre>
// Valid constant names
define("ONE",     "first thing");
define("TWO2",    "second thing");
define("THREE_3", "third thing")
// Invalid constant names
define("2TWO",    "second thing");
define("__THREE__", "third value"); 
</pre></td></tr></table>
<h2>PHP Magic constants:</h2>
<p>PHP provides a large number of predefined constants to any script which it runs.</p>
<p>There are five magical constants that change depending on where they are used. For example, the value of __LINE__ depends on the line that it's used on in your script. These special constants are case-insensitive and are as follows:</p>
<p>A few "magical" PHP constants ate given below:</p>
<table  class="src" border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>__LINE__</b></td><td>The current line number of the file.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>__FILE__</b></td><td>The full path and filename of the file.  If used inside an include,the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, <b>__FILE__</b> always contains an absolute path whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>__FUNCTION__</b></td><td>The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0)  As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive).  In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased. </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>__CLASS__</b></td><td>The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0)  As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive).  In PHP   4 its value is always lowercased. </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>__METHOD__</b></td><td> The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0)  The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).</td></tr>
</table>
