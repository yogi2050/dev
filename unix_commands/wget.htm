<h1 class="manpages">NAME</h1>
Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.
<h1 class="manpages">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
wget [<i>option</i>]... [<i><font size="-1">URL</font></i>]...
<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
<font size="-1">GNU</font> Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports <font size="-1">HTTP</font>, <font size="-1">HTTPS</font>, and <font size="-1">FTP</font> protocols, as
well as retrieval through <font size="-1">HTTP</font> proxies.
<p>
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user&#146;s presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
<p>
Wget can follow links in <font size="-1">HTML</font> and <font size="-1">XHTML</font> pages and create local
versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of
the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as recursive
downloading.  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
Standard (<i>/robots.txt</i>).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
links in downloaded <font size="-1">HTML</font> files to the local files for offline
viewing.
<p>
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
download from where it left off.
<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS</h1>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
<h1 class="manpages">Option Syntax</h1>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Since Wget uses <font size="-1">GNU</font> getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are
more convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely
mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:
<p>
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -r --tries=10 <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr</a>/ -o log
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted.  Instead of <b>-o log</b> you can write <b>-olog</b>.
<p>
You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:
<p>
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -drc &lt;URL&gt;
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is a complete equivalent of:
<p>
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt;
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <b>--</b>.  So the following will try to download
<font size="-1">URL</font> <b>-x</b>, reporting failure to <i>log</i>:
<p>
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -o log -- -x
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be useful to
clear the <i>.wgetrc</i> settings.  For instance, if your <i>.wgetrc</i>
sets <tt>exclude_directories</tt> to <i>/cgi-bin</i>, the following
example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude <i>/~nobody</i>
and <i>/~somebody</i>.  You can also clear the lists in <i>.wgetrc</i>.
<p>
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -X " -X /~nobody,/~somebody
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Most options that do not accept arguments are <i>boolean</i> options,
so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
(boolean) variable.  For example, <b>--follow-ftp</b> tells Wget
to follow <font size="-1">FTP</font> links from <font size="-1">HTML</font> files and, on the other hand,
<b>--no-glob</b> tells it not to perform file globbing on <font size="-1">FTP</font> URLs.  A
boolean option is either <i>affirmative</i> or <i>negative</i>
(beginning with <b>--no</b>).  All such options share several
properties.
<p>
Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the
documented existence of <b>--follow-ftp</b> assumes that the default
is to <i>not</i> follow <font size="-1">FTP</font> links from <font size="-1">HTML</font> pages.
<p>
Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <b>--no-</b> to
the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the
<b>--no-</b> prefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for
an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way
to explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change
the default.  For instance, using <tt>follow_ftp = off</tt> in
<i>.wgetrc</i> makes Wget <i>not</i> follow <font size="-1">FTP</font> links by default, and
using <b>--no-follow-ftp</b> is the only way to restore the factory
default from the command line.

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command

harm if it is)---it is enough if the URLs are just listed
sequentially.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
However, if you specify <b>--force-html</b>, the document will be
regarded as <b>html</b>.  In that case you may have problems with
relative links, which you can solve either by adding <tt>&lt;base

The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
will be concatenated together and written to <i>file</i>.  If <b>-</b>
is used as <i>file</i>, documents will be printed to standard output,
disabling link conversion.  (Use <b>./-</b> to print to a file
literally named <b>-</b>.)
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Use of <b>-O</b> is <i>not</i> intended to mean simply "use the name
<i>file</i> instead of the one in the <font size="-1">URL</font>;" rather, it is
analogous to shell redirection:
<b>wget -O file <a href="http://foo/">http://foo</a></b> is intended to work like
<b>wget -O - <a href="http://foo/">http://foo</a> &gt; file</b>; <i>file</i> will be truncated
immediately, and <i>all</i> downloaded content will be written there.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
For this reason, <b>-N</b> (for timestamp-checking) is not supported
in combination with <b>-O</b>: since <i>file</i> is always newly
created, it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Similarly, using <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b> with <b>-O</b> may not work as
you expect: Wget won&#146;t just download the first file to <i>file</i> and
then download the rest to their normal names: <i>all</i> downloaded
content will be placed in <i>file</i>. This was disabled in version
1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are
some cases where this behavior can actually have some use.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that a combination with <b>-k</b> is only permitted when
downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert
all relative URIs to external ones; <b>-k</b> makes no sense for
multiple URIs when they&#146;re all being downloaded to a single file.

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget&#146;s
behavior depends on a few options, including <b>-nc</b>.  In certain
cases, the local file will be <i>clobbered</i>, or overwritten, upon
repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When running Wget without <b>-N</b>, <b>-nc</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>p</b>,
downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the
original copy of <i>file</i> being preserved and the second copy being
named <i>file</i><b>.1</b>.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the
third copy will be named <i>file</i><b>.2</b>, and so on.  When
<b>-nc</b> is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will
refuse to download newer copies of <i>file</i>.  Therefore,
"<tt>no-clobber</tt>" is actually a misnomer in this mode---it&#146;s not
clobbering that&#146;s prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that&#146;s
prevented.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When running Wget with <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b>, but without <b>-N</b>
or <b>-nc</b>, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy
simply overwriting the old.  Adding <b>-nc</b> will prevent this
behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved and any
newer copies on the server to be ignored.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When running Wget with <b>-N</b>, with or without <b>-r</b> or
<b>-p</b>, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy
of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the
file.  <b>-nc</b> may not be specified at the
same time as <b>-N</b>.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that when <b>-nc</b> is specified, files with the suffixes
<b>.html</b> or <b>.htm</b> will be loaded from the local disk and
parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.

<b>--continue</b>

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program.  For instance:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

        wget -c <a href="ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z">ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z</a>
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If there is a file named <i>ls-lR.Z</i> in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that you don&#146;t need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior.
<b>-c</b> only affects resumption of downloads started <i>prior</i> to
this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Without <b>-c</b>, the previous example would just download the remote
file to <i>ls-lR.Z.1</i>, leaving the truncated <i>ls-lR.Z</i> file
alone.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <b>-c</b> on a non-empty file, and
it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to
start from scratch, remove the file.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <b>-c</b> on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file
is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed
on the server since your last download attempt)---because continuing
is not meaningful, no download occurs.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
On the other side of the coin, while using <b>-c</b>, any file that&#146;s
bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
download and only <tt>(length(remote) - length(local))</tt> bytes will be
downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can
be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use <b>wget -c</b>
to download just the new portion that&#146;s been appended to a data
collection or log file.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
However, if the file is bigger on the server because it&#146;s been
<i>changed</i>, as opposed to just <i>appended</i> to, you&#146;ll end up
with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file
is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially
careful of this when using <b>-c</b> in conjunction with <b>-r</b>,
since every file will be considered as an incomplete download candidate.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Another instance where you&#146;ll get a garbled file if you try to use
<b>-c</b> is if you have a lame <font size="-1">HTTP</font> proxy that inserts a
transfer interrupted string into the local file.  In the future a
rollback option may be added to deal with this case.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that <b>-c</b> only works with <font size="-1">FTP</font> servers and with <font size="-1">HTTP</font>
servers that support the <tt>Range</tt> header.

The bar indicator is used by default.  It draws an <font size="-1">ASCII</font> progress

Use <b>--progress=dot</b> to switch to the dot display.  It traces
the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of downloaded data.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the <i>style</i> by
specifying the type as <b>dot:</b><i>style</i>.  Different styles assign
different meaning to one dot.  With the <tt>default</tt> style each dot
represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.
The <tt>binary</tt> style has a more computer-like orientation---8K
dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
lines).  The <tt>mega</tt> style is suitable for downloading very large
files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that you can set the default style using the <tt>progress</tt>
command in <i>.wgetrc</i>.  That setting may be overridden from the
command line.  The exception is that, when the output is not a <font size="-1">TTY</font>, the
dot progress will be favored over bar.  To force the bar output,
use <b>--progress=bar:force</b>.

When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and

This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction

Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate

Turn off caching of <font size="-1">DNS</font> lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the <font size="-1">IP</font>

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid as part of

defaults, either because you are downloading to a non-native partition,
or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When mode is set to unix, Wget escapes the character <b>/</b> and
the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is the
default on Unix-like <font size="-1">OS</font>&#146;es.

<b>&gt;</b>, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.
In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses <b>+</b> instead of
<b>:</b> to separate host and port in local file names, and uses
<b>@</b> instead of <b>?</b> to separate the query portion of the file
name from the rest.  Therefore, a <font size="-1">URL</font> that would be saved as
<b>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</b> in Unix mode would be
saved as <b>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</b> in Windows
mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.

If you append <b>,nocontrol</b> to the mode, as in

you&#146;re mirroring a remote site that uses <b>.asp</b> pages, but you want
the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another
good use for this is when you&#146;re downloading CGI-generated materials.  A <font size="-1">URL</font>

Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining
server-side state.  The server sends the client a cookie using the

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.  The login
process typically works by the web server issuing an <font size="-1">HTTP</font> cookie
upon receiving and verifying your credentials.  The cookie is then
resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so
proves your identity.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved by
<b>--load-cookies</b>---simply point Wget to the location of the
<i>cookies.txt</i> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
cookie files in different locations:

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
When specified, causes <b>--save-cookies</b> to also save session

meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.
Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit
the home page before you can access some pages.  With this option,
multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as
the site is concerned.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies,
Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget&#146;s
<b>--load-cookies</b> recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want

Unfortunately, some <font size="-1">HTTP</font> servers (<font size="-1">CGI</font> programs, to be more

this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,

The <font size="-1">HTTP</font> protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a

However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the <tt>User-Agent</tt>-supplied information.
While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by
servers denying information to clients other than (historically)
Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Use <font size="-1">POST</font> as the method for all <font size="-1">HTTP</font> requests and send the specified data

whereas <tt>--post-file</tt> sends the contents of <i>file</i>.  Other than
that, they work in exactly the same way.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the <font size="-1">POST</font> data in
advance.  Therefore the argument to <tt>--post-file</tt> must be a regular
file; specifying a <font size="-1">FIFO</font> or something like <i>/dev/stdin</i> won&#146;t work.
It&#146;s not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in
<font size="-1">HTTP/1</font>.0.  Although <font size="-1">HTTP/1</font>.1 introduces <i>chunked</i> transfer that
doesn&#146;t require knowing the request length in advance, a client can&#146;t
use chunked unless it knows it&#146;s talking to an <font size="-1">HTTP/1</font>.1 server.  And it
can&#146;t know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the
request to have been completed &#151; a chicken-and-egg problem.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note: if Wget is redirected after the <font size="-1">POST</font> request is completed, it
will not send the <font size="-1">POST</font> data to the redirected <font size="-1">URL</font>.  This is because
URLs that process <font size="-1">POST</font> often respond with a redirection to a regular
page, which does not desire or accept <font size="-1">POST</font>.  It is not completely
clear that this behavior is optimal; if it doesn&#146;t work out, it might
be changed in the future.

library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the random
number generator used to produce cryptographically strong keys.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using the
<tt>RAND_FILE</tt> environment variable.  If this variable is unset, or
if the specified file does not produce enough randomness, OpenSSL will
read random data from <font size="-1">EGD</font> socket specified using this option.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command is
not used), <font size="-1">EGD</font> is never contacted.  <font size="-1">EGD</font> is not needed on modern Unix
systems that support <i>/dev/random</i>.

Another way to specify username and password is in the <font size="-1">URL</font> itself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who

store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or <i>.netrc</i>, and make sure to protect

really important, do not leave them lying in those files either---edit

<b>--no-remove-listing</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Don&#146;t remove the temporary <i>.listing</i> files generated by <font size="-1">FTP</font>
retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings
received from <font size="-1">FTP</font> servers.  Not removing them can be useful for
debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror
you&#146;re running is complete).
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file,
this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
<i>.listing</i> a symbolic link to <i>/etc/passwd</i> or something and
asking <tt>root</tt> to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on
the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to <i>.listing</i>,
making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
<i>.listing</i> file, or the listing will be written to a
<i>.listing.</i><i>number</i><i></i> file.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Even though this situation isn&#146;t a problem, though, <tt>root</tt> should
never run Wget in a non-trusted user&#146;s directory.  A user could do
something as simple as linking <i>index.html</i> to <i>/etc/passwd</i>
and asking <tt>root</tt> to run Wget with <b>-N</b> or <b>-r</b> so the file
will be overwritten.

<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
<b>--no-glob</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Turn off <font size="-1">FTP</font> globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
special characters (<i>wildcards</i>), like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>
and <b>]</b> to retrieve more than one file from the same directory at
once, like:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget <a href="ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/">ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/</a>*.msg
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
By default, globbing will be turned on if the <font size="-1">URL</font> contains a
globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
You may have to quote the <font size="-1">URL</font> to protect it from being expanded by
your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is
system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with Unix <font size="-1">FTP</font>
servers (and the ones emulating Unix <tt>ls</tt> output).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
<b>--no-passive-ftp</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Disable the use of the <i>passive</i> <font size="-1">FTP</font> transfer mode.  Passive <font size="-1">FTP</font>
mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data
connection rather than the other way around.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and
active <font size="-1">FTP</font> should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and <font size="-1">NAT</font>
configurations passive <font size="-1">FTP</font> has a better chance of working.  However,
in some rare firewall configurations, active <font size="-1">FTP</font> actually works when
passive <font size="-1">FTP</font> doesn&#146;t.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this
option, or set <tt>passive_ftp=off</tt> in your init file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
<b>--retr-symlinks</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Usually, when retrieving <font size="-1">FTP</font> directories recursively and a symbolic
link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.  Instead, a
matching symbolic link is created on the local filesystem.  The
pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this recursive retrieval
would have encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
When <b>--retr-symlinks</b> is specified, however, symbolic links are
traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time, this
option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to directories and
recurse through them, but in the future it should be enhanced to do
this.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed in this
case.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
<b>--no-http-keep-alive</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Turn off the keep-alive feature for <font size="-1">HTTP</font> downloads.  Normally, Wget
asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you download
more than one document from the same server, they get transferred over
the same <font size="-1">TCP</font> connection.  This saves time and at the same time reduces
the load on the server.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive)
connections don&#146;t work for you, for example due to a server bug or due
to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections.

The <b>-r</b> option is to retrieve recursively, and <b>-nd</b> to not

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that <b>--delete-after</b> deletes files on the local machine.  It
does not issue the <b><font size="-1">DELE</font></b> command to remote <font size="-1">FTP</font> sites, for
instance.  Also note that when <b>--delete-after</b> is specified,

<b>--convert-links</b>

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
content, etc.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
*
</td><td>
The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Example: if the downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
<i>/bar/img.gif</i>, also downloaded, then the link in <i>doc.html</i>
will be modified to point to <b>../bar/img.gif</b>.  This kind of
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
*
</td><td>
The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Example: if the downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
<i>/bar/img.gif</i> (or to <i>../bar/img.gif</i>), then the link in
<i>doc.html</i> will be modified to point to
<i>http://</i><i>hostname</i><i>/bar/img.gif</i>.
</td></tr>

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by <b>-k</b> will be
performed at the end of all the downloads.

<b>--page-requisites</b>

This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given <font size="-1">HTML</font> page.  This includes such things as
inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Ordinarily, when downloading a single <font size="-1">HTML</font> page, any requisite documents
that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using
<b>-r</b> together with <b>-l</b> can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is
generally left with leaf documents that are missing their
requisites.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
For instance, say document <i>1.html</i> contains an <tt>&lt;IMG&gt;</tt> tag
referencing <i>1.gif</i> and an <tt>&lt;A&gt;</tt> tag pointing to external
document <i>2.html</i>.  Say that <i>2.html</i> is similar but that its
image is <i>2.gif</i> and it links to <i>3.html</i>.  Say this
continues up to some arbitrarily high number.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If one executes the command:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -r -l 2 http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html

</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
then <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, <i>2.gif</i>, and
<i>3.html</i> will be downloaded.  As you can see, <i>3.html</i> is
without its requisite <i>3.gif</i> because Wget is simply counting the
number of hops (up to 2) away from <i>1.html</i> in order to determine
where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -r -l 2 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
</tt></pre></td></tr>

<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
all the above files <i>and</i> <i>3.html</i>&#146;s requisite <i>3.gif</i>

</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
will cause <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, and <i>2.gif</i>
to be downloaded.  One might think that:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -r -l 0 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
would download just <i>1.html</i> and <i>1.gif</i>, but unfortunately
this is not the case, because <b>-l 0</b> is equivalent to
<b>-l inf</b>---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single <font size="-1">HTML</font>
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
<b>-i</b> <font size="-1">URL</font> input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
<b>-r</b> and <b>-l</b>:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note that Wget will behave as if <b>-r</b> had been specified, but only
that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that
page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate
websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to <b>-p</b>:
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
<tt><table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<!-- ignored unsupported tag .ne -->
        wget -E -H -k -K -p http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;
</tt></pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
To finish off this topic, it&#146;s worth knowing that Wget&#146;s idea of an
external document link is any <font size="-1">URL</font> specified in an <tt>&lt;A&gt;</tt> tag, an
<tt>&lt;AREA&gt;</tt> tag, or a <tt>&lt;LINK&gt;</tt> tag other than <tt>&lt;LINK
REL="stylesheet"&gt;</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=4%>
<b>--strict-comments</b>
</td><td>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .tm -->
Turn on strict parsing of <font size="-1">HTML</font> comments.  The default is to terminate
comments at the first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b>.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
According to specifications, <font size="-1">HTML</font> comments are expressed as <font size="-1">SGML</font>
<i>declarations</i>.  Declaration is special markup that begins with
<b>&lt;!</b> and ends with <b>&gt;</b>, such as <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</b>, that
may contain comments between a pair of <b>--</b> delimiters.  <font size="-1">HTML</font>
comments are empty declarations, <font size="-1">SGML</font> declarations without any
non-comment text.  Therefore, <b>&lt;!--foo&#151;&gt;</b> is a valid comment, and
so is <b>&lt;!--one&#151; --two&#151;&gt;</b>, but <b>&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</b> is not.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
On the other hand, most <font size="-1">HTML</font> writers don&#146;t perceive comments as anything
other than text delimited with <b>&lt;!--</b> and <b>--&gt;</b>, which is not
quite the same.  For example, something like <b>&lt;!------------&gt;</b>
works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple
of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next
<b>--</b>, which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of
this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
<b>&lt;!--</b> and <b>--&gt;</b>.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in
missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had
the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.  Beginning with
version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements
naive comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
<b>--&gt;</b>.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
option to turn it on.

Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
<i>.wgetrc</i> file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with <i>.wgetrc</i> moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
<i>.wgetrc</i> settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of
the file.

Please start Wget with <b>-d</b> option and send us the resulting
output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without
debug support, recompile it---it is <i>much</i> easier to trace bugs
with debug support on.
<p>
<!-- ignored unsupported tag .if -->
Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information
from the debug log before sending it to the bug address.  The
<tt>-d</tt> won&#146;t go out of its way to collect sensitive information,
but the log <i>will</i> contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget&#146;s
communication with the server, which may include passwords and pieces
of downloaded data.  Since the bug address is publically archived, you
may assume that all bug reports are visible to the public.

If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. <tt>gdb &#145;which
wget&#145; core</tt> and type <tt>where</tt> to get the backtrace.  This may not
work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is
safe to try.
