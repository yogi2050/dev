<h1 class="manpages">NAME</h1>
dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.
<h1 class="manpages">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<b>dnsmasq</b> <i>[OPTION]...</i> <h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<b>dnsmasq</b> is a lightweight DNS, TFTP and DHCP server. It is intended to provide
coupled DNS and DHCP service to a LAN.
<p>
Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local,
cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server. It loads the
contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames
which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved and also answers
DNS queries for DHCP configured hosts.
<p>
The dnsmasq DHCP server supports static address assignments, multiple
networks, DHCP-relay and RFC3011 subnet specifiers. It automatically
sends a sensible default set of DHCP options, and can be configured to
send any desired set of DHCP options, including vendor-encapsulated
options. It includes a secure, read-only,
TFTP server to allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts and also supports BOOTP.
<p>
Dnsmasq
supports IPv6 for DNS, but not DHCP.
<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS</h1>
Note that in general missing parameters are allowed and switch off
functions, for instance "--pid-file" disables writing a PID file. On
BSD, unless the GNU getopt library is linked, the long form of the
options does not work on the command line; it is still recognised in
the configuration file.
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-h, --no-hosts</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Don&#146;t read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-H, --addn-hosts=&lt;file&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If -h is given, read
only the specified file. This option may be repeated for more than one
additional hosts file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-E, --expand-hosts</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts
in the same way as for DHCP-derived names.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-T, --local-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
When replying with information from /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases
file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning
that the requestor should not itself cache the information. This is
the correct thing to do in almost all situations. This option allows a
time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies. This will
reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale
data under some circumstances.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>--neg-ttl=&lt;time&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Negative replies from upstream servers normally contain time-to-live
information in SOA records which dnsmasq uses for caching. If the
replies from upstream servers omit this information, dnsmasq does not
cache the reply. This option gives a default value for time-to-live
(in seconds) which dnsmasq uses to cache negative replies even in
the absence of an SOA record.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-k, --keep-in-foreground</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Do not go into the background at startup but otherwise run as
normal. This is intended for use when dnsmasq is run under daemontools
or launchd.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-d, --no-daemon</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Debug mode: don&#146;t fork to the background, don&#146;t write a pid file,
don&#146;t change user id, generate a complete cache dump on receipt on
SIGUSR1, log to stderr as well as syslog, don&#146;t fork new processes
to handle TCP queries.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-q, --log-queries</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Log the results of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-8, --log-facility=&lt;facility&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this
defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in operation. If
the facility given contains at least one &#146;/&#146; character, it is taken to
be a filename, and dnsmasq logs to the given file, instead of
syslog. (Errors whilst reading configuration will still go to syslog,
but all output from a successful startup, and all output whilst
running, will go exclusively to the file.) When logging to a file,
dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it receives SIGUSR2. This
allows the log file to be rotated without stopping dnsmasq.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>--log-async[=&lt;lines&gt;]</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Enable asynchronous logging and optionally set the limit on the
number of lines
which will be queued by dnsmasq when writing to the syslog is slow.
Dnsmasq can log asynchronously: this
allows it to continue functioning without being blocked by syslog, and
allows syslog to use dnsmasq for DNS queries without risking deadlock.
If the queue of log-lines becomes full, dnsmasq will log the
overflow, and the number of messages  lost. The default queue length is
5, a sane value would be 5-25, and a maximum limit of 100 is imposed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-x, --pid-file=&lt;path&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specify an alternate path for dnsmasq to record its process-id in. Normally /var/run/dnsmasq.pid.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-u, --user=&lt;username&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specify the userid to which dnsmasq will change after startup. Dnsmasq must normally be started as root, but it will drop root
privileges after startup by changing id to another user. Normally this user is "nobody" but that
can be over-ridden with this switch.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-g, --group=&lt;groupname&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specify the group which dnsmasq will run
as. The defaults to "dip", if available, to facilitate access to
/etc/ppp/resolv.conf which is not normally world readable.

<b>-v, --version</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>

<b>-p, --port=&lt;port&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Listen on &lt;port&gt; instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this

for ethernet.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-Q, --query-port=&lt;query_port&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies on, the
specific UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of using random ports. NOTE
that using this option will make dnsmasq less secure against DNS
spoofing attacks but it may be faster and use less resources.  Setting this option
to zero makes dnsmasq use a single port allocated to it by the
OS: this was the default behaviour in versions prior to 2.43.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>--min-port=&lt;port&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Do not use ports less than that given as source for outbound DNS
queries. Dnsmasq picks random ports as source for outbound queries:
when this option is given, the ports used will always to larger

<b>-i, --interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds
the loopback (local) interface to the list of interfaces to use when
the
<b>--interface</b> option  is used. If no
<b>--interface</b> or
<b>--listen-address</b> options are given dnsmasq listens on all available interfaces except any
given in
<b>--except-interface</b> options. IP alias interfaces (eg "eth1:0") cannot be used with
<b>--interface</b> or

<b>-I, --except-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Do not listen on the specified interface. Note that the order of
<b>--listen-address</b> <b>--interface</b> and
<b>--except-interface</b> options does not matter and that
<b>--except-interface</b> options always override the others.

<b>-2, --no-dhcp-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide DNS service.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-a, --listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Listen on the given IP address(es). Both
<b>--interface</b> and
<b>--listen-address</b> options may be given, in which case the set of both interfaces and
addresses is used. Note that if no
<b>--interface</b> option is given, but
<b>--listen-address</b> is, dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback
interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be
explicitly given as a
<b>--listen-address</b> option.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-z, --bind-interfaces</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
requests that it shouldn&#146;t reply to. This has the advantage of
working even when interfaces come and go and change address. This
option forces dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is
listening on. About the only time when this is useful is when
running another nameserver (or another instance of dnsmasq) on the
same machine. Setting this option also enables multiple instances of
dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run in the same machine.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-y, --localise-queries</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Return answers to DNS queries from /etc/hosts which depend on the interface over which the query was
received. If a name in /etc/hosts has more than one address associated with
it, and at least one of those addresses is on the same subnet as the
interface to which the query was sent, then return only the
address(es) on that subnet. This allows for a server  to have multiple
addresses in /etc/hosts corresponding to each of its interfaces, and
hosts will get the correct address based on which network they are
attached to. Currently this facility is limited to IPv4.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-b, --bogus-priv</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc)

with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream.

<b>-V, --alias=&lt;old-ip&gt;,&lt;new-ip&gt;[,&lt;mask&gt;]</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Modify IPv4 addresses returned from upstream nameservers; old-ip is
replaced by new-ip. If the optional mask is given then any address
which matches the masked old-ip will be re-written. So, for instance
<b>--alias=1.2.3.0,6.7.8.0,255.255.255.0</b> will map 1.2.3.56 to 6.7.8.56 and 1.2.3.67 to 6.7.8.67. This is what
Cisco PIX routers call "DNS doctoring".

<b>-B, --bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt;</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Transform replies which contain the IP address given into "No such
domain" replies. This is intended to counteract a devious move made by
Verisign in September 2003 when they started returning the address of
an advertising web page in response to queries for unregistered names,
instead of the correct NXDOMAIN response. This option tells dnsmasq to
fake the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept 2003
the IP address being returned by Verisign is 64.94.110.11

Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don&#146;t get sensible answers from

repeated domain or ipaddr parts as required.

Also permitted is a -S

a domain is local and it may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP
but should never forward queries on that domain to any upstream

<b>local</b> is a synonym for
<b>server</b> to make configuration files clearer in this case.

The optional string after the @ character tells
dnsmasq how to set the source of the queries to this

dnsmasq is running otherwise this server line will be logged and then
ignored, or an interface name. If an interface name is given, then
queries to the server will be forced via that interface; if an
ip-address is given then the source address of the queries will be set
to that address.
The query-port flag is ignored for any servers which have a
source address specified but the port may be specified directly as
part of the source address. Forcing queries to an interface is not
implemented on all platforms supported by dnsmasq.

minimum lease time is two minutes. This
option may be repeated, with different addresses, to enable DHCP
service to more than one network. For directly connected networks (ie,
networks on which the machine running dnsmasq has an interface) the
netmask is optional. It is, however, required for networks which
receive DHCP service via a relay agent. The broadcast address is
always optional. On some broken systems, dnsmasq can listen on only
one interface when using DHCP, and the name of that interface must be

Specify per host parameters for the DHCP server. This allows a machine
with a particular hardware address to be always allocated the same
hostname, IP address and lease time. A hostname specified like this
overrides any supplied by the DHCP client on the machine. It is also
allowable to ommit the hardware address and include the hostname, in
which case the IP address and lease times will apply to any machine
claiming that name. For example
<b>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,wap,infinite</b> tells dnsmasq to give
the machine with hardware address 00:20:e0:3b:13:af the name wap, and
an infinite DHCP lease.
<b>--dhcp-host=lap,192.168.0.199</b> tells
dnsmasq to always allocate the machine lap the IP address
192.168.0.199. Addresses allocated like this are not constrained to be
in the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they must be on the
network being served by the DHCP server. It is allowed to use client identifiers rather than
hardware addresses to identify hosts by prefixing with &#146;id:&#146;. Thus:
<b>--dhcp-host=id:01:02:03:04,.....</b> refers to the host with client identifier 01:02:03:04. It is also
allowed to specify the client ID as text, like this:
<b>--dhcp-host=id:clientidastext,.....</b> The special option id:* means "ignore any client-id
and use MAC addresses only." This is useful when a client presents a client-id sometimes
but not others.
If a name appears in /etc/hosts, the associated address can be
allocated to a DHCP lease, but only if a
<b>--dhcp-host</b> option specifying the name also exists. The special keyword "ignore"
tells dnsmasq to never offer a DHCP lease to a machine. The machine
can be specified by hardware address, client ID or hostname, for
instance
<b>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore</b> This is
useful when there is another DHCP server on the network which should
be used by some machines. The net:&lt;network-id&gt; sets the network-id tag
whenever this dhcp-host directive is in use.This can be used to
selectively send DHCP options just for this host. When a host matches any
dhcp-host directive (or one implied by /etc/ethers) then the special
network-id tag "known" is set. This allows dnsmasq to be configured to
ignore requests from unknown machines using
<b>--dhcp-ignore=#known</b> Ethernet addresses (but not client-ids) may have
wildcard bytes, so for example
<b>--dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:*,ignore</b> will cause dnsmasq to ignore a range of hardware addresses. Note that
the "*" will need to be escaped or quoted on a command line, but not
in the configuration file. Hardware addresses normally match any
network (ARP) type, but it is possible to restrict them to a single
ARP type by preceding them with the ARP-type (in HEX) and "-". so
<b>--dhcp-host=06-00:20:e0:3b:13:af,1.2.3.4</b> will only match a
Token-Ring hardware address, since the ARP-address type for token ring
is 6.

Specify different or extra options to DHCP clients. By default,
dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP clients, the netmask and
broadcast address are set to the same as the host running dnsmasq, and
the DNS server and default route are set to the address of the machine
running dnsmasq. If the domain name option has been set, that is sent.
This configuration allows these defaults to be overridden,
or other options specified. The option, to be sent may be given as a
decimal number or as "option:&lt;option-name&gt;" The option numbers are
specified in RFC2132 and subsequent RFCs. The set of option-names
known by dnsmasq can be discovered by running "dnsmasq --help dhcp".
For example, to set the default route option to
192.168.4.4, do
<b>--dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4</b> or
<b>--dhcp-option = option:router, 192.168.4.4</b> and to set the time-server address to 192.168.0.4, do
<b>--dhcp-option = 42,192.168.0.4</b> or
<b>--dhcp-option = option:ntp-server, 192.168.0.4</b> The special address 0.0.0.0 is taken to mean "the address of the
machine running dnsmasq". Data types allowed are comma separated
dotted-quad IP addresses, a decimal number, colon-separated hex digits
and a text string. If the optional network-ids are given then
this option is only sent when all the network-ids are matched.
<p>
Special processing is done on a text argument for option 119, to
conform with RFC 3397. Text or dotted-quad IP addresses as arguments
to option 120 are handled as per RFC 3361. Dotted-quad IP addresses
which are followed by a slash and then a netmask size are encoded as
described in RFC 3442.
<p>
Be careful: no checking is done that the correct type of data for the
option number is sent, it is quite possible to
persuade dnsmasq to generate illegal DHCP packets with injudicious use
of this flag. When the value is a decimal number, dnsmasq must determine how
large the data item is. It does this by examining the option number and/or the
value, but can be overridden by appending a single letter flag as follows:
b = one byte, s = two bytes, i = four bytes. This is mainly useful with
encapsulated vendor class options (see below) where dnsmasq cannot
determine data size from the  option number. Option data which
consists solely of periods and digits will be interpreted by dnsmasq
as an IP address, and inserted into an option as such. To force a
literal string, use quotes. For instance when using option 66 to send
a literal IP address as TFTP server name, it is necessary to do
<b>--dhcp-option=66, 1.2.3.4</b> <p>
Encapsulated Vendor-class options may also be specified using
--dhcp-option: for instance
<b>--dhcp-option=vendor:PXEClient,1,0.0.0.0</b> sends the encapsulated vendor
class-specific option "mftp-address=0.0.0.0" to any client whose
vendor-class matches "PXEClient". The vendor-class matching is
substring based (see --dhcp-vendorclass for details). If a
vendor-class option (number 60) is sent by dnsmasq, then that is used
for selecting encapsulated options in preference to any sent by the
client. It is
possible to omit the vendorclass completely;
<b>--dhcp-option=vendor:,1,0.0.0.0</b> in which case the encapsulated option is always sent.
The address 0.0.0.0 is not treated specially in
encapsulated vendor class options.

Whenever a new DHCP lease is created, or an old one destroyed, the
binary specified by this option is run. The arguments to the process
are "add", "old" or "del", the MAC
address of the host (or "&lt;null&gt;"), the IP address, and the hostname,
if known. "add" means a lease has been created, "del" means it has
been destroyed, "old" is a notification of an existing lease when
dnsmasq starts or a change to MAC address or hostname of an existing
lease (also, lease length or expiry and client-id, if leasefile-ro is set).
The process is run as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as
root) even if dnsmasq is configured to change UID to an unprivileged user.
The environment is inherited from the invoker of dnsmasq, and if the
host provided a client-id, this is stored in the environment variable
DNSMASQ_CLIENT_ID. If the client provides vendor-class or user-class
information, these are provided in DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS and
DNSMASQ_USER_CLASS0..DNSMASQ_USER_CLASSn variables, but only for
"add" actions or "old" actions when a host resumes an existing lease,
since these data are not held in dnsmasq&#146;s lease
database. If dnsmasq was compiled with HAVE_BROKEN_RTC, then
the length of the lease (in seconds) is stored in
DNSMASQ_LEASE_LENGTH, otherwise the time of lease expiry is stored in
DNSMASQ_LEASE_EXPIRES. The number of seconds until lease expiry is
always stored in DNSMASQ_TIME_REMAINING.
If a lease used to have a hostname, which is
removed, an "old" event is generated with the new state of the lease,
ie no name, and the former name is provided in the environment
variable DNSMASQ_OLD_HOSTNAME. DNSMASQ_INTERFACE stores the name of
the interface on which the request arrived; this is not set for "old"
actions when dnsmasq restarts.
All file descriptors are
closed except stdin, stdout and stderr which are open to /dev/null
(except in debug mode).
The script is not invoked concurrently: if subsequent lease
changes occur, the script is not invoked again until any existing
invocation exits. At dnsmasq startup, the script will be invoked for
all existing leases as they are read from the lease file. Expired
leases will be called with "del" and others with "old". &lt;path&gt;
must be an absolute pathname, no PATH search occurs. When dnsmasq
receives a HUP signal, the script will be invoked for existing leases
with an "old " event.

firstly it causes the DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts

its name via dhcp as e.g. "microsoft.com" and capture traffic not
meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP
hostname with a domain part (ie with a period) will be disallowed
and logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain
part are allowed, provided the domain part matches the suffix. In
addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a domain
part have the suffix added as an optional domain part. Eg on my network I can set

</table>
<h1 class="manpages">CONFIG FILE</h1>
At startup, dnsmasq reads
<i>/etc/dnsmasq.conf,</i> if it exists. (On
FreeBSD, the file is
<i>/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf</i> ) (but see the
<b>-C</b> and
<b>-7</b> options.) The format of this
file consists of one option per line, exactly as the long options detailed
in the OPTIONS section but without the leading "--". Lines starting with # are comments and ignored. For
options which may only be specified once, the configuration file overrides
the command line.  Quoting is allowed in a config file:
between " quotes the special meanings of ,:. and # are removed and the
following escapes are allowed: \\ \" \t \e \b \r and \n. The later
corresponding to tab, escape, backspace, return and newline.
<h1 class="manpages">NOTES</h1>
When it receives a SIGHUP,
<b>dnsmasq</b> clears its cache and then re-loads
<i>/etc/hosts</i> and
<i>/etc/ethers</i> and any file given by --dhcp-hostsfile, --dhcp-optsfile or --addn-hosts.
The dhcp lease change script is called for all
existing DHCP leases. If
<b></b> --no-poll
is set SIGHUP also re-reads
<i>/etc/resolv.conf.</i> SIGHUP
does NOT re-read the configuration file.
<p>
When it receives a SIGUSR1,
<b>dnsmasq</b> writes statistics to the system log. It writes the cache size,
the number of names which have had to removed from the cache before
they expired in order to make room for new names and the total number
of names that have been inserted into the cache. For each upstream
server it gives the number of queries sent, and the number which
resulted in an error. In
<b>--no-daemon</b> mode or when full logging is enabled (-q), a complete dump of the
contents of the cache is made.
<p>
When it receives SIGUSR2 and it is logging direct to a file (see
<b>--log-facility</b> )
<b>dnsmasq</b> will close and reopen the log file. Note that during this operation,
dnsmasq will not be running as root. When it first creates the logfile
dnsmasq changes the ownership of the file to the non-root user it will run
as. Logrotate should be configured to create a new log file with
the ownership which matches the existing one before sending SIGUSR2.
If TCP DNS queries are in progress, the old logfile will remain open in
child processes which are handling TCP queries and may continue to be
written. There is a limit of 150 seconds, after which all existing TCP
processes will have expired: for this reason, it is not wise to
configure logfile compression for logfiles which have just been
rotated. Using logrotate, the required options are
<b>create</b> and
<b>delaycompress.</b> <p>
<p>
<p>
Dnsmasq is a DNS query forwarder: it it not capable of recursively
answering arbitrary queries starting from the root servers but
forwards such queries to a fully recursive upstream DNS server which is
typically provided by an ISP. By default, dnsmasq reads
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> to discover the IP
addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use, since the
information is typically stored there. Unless
<b>--no-poll</b> is used,
<b>dnsmasq</b> checks the modification time of
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> (or equivalent if
<b>--resolv-file</b> is used) and re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers to
be set dynamically by PPP or DHCP since both protocols provide the
information.
Absence of
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> is not an error
since it may not have been created before a PPP connection exists. Dnsmasq
simply keeps checking in case
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> is created at any
time. Dnsmasq can be told to parse more than one resolv.conf
file. This is useful on a laptop, where both PPP and DHCP may be used:
dnsmasq can be set to poll both
<i>/etc/ppp/resolv.conf</i> and
<i>/etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf</i> and will use the contents of whichever changed
last, giving automatic switching between DNS servers.
<p>
Upstream servers may also be specified on the command line or in
the configuration file. These server specifications optionally take a
domain name which tells dnsmasq to use that server only to find names
in that particular domain.
<p>
In order to configure dnsmasq to act as cache for the host on which it is running, put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in
<i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> to force local processes to send queries to
dnsmasq. Then either specify the upstream servers directly to dnsmasq
using
<b>--server</b> options or put their addresses real in another file, say
<i>/etc/resolv.dnsmasq</i> and run dnsmasq with the
<b>-r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq</b> option. This second technique allows for dynamic update of the server
addresses by PPP or DHCP.
<p>
Addresses in /etc/hosts will "shadow" different addresses for the same
names in the upstream DNS, so "mycompany.com 1.2.3.4" in /etc/hosts will ensure that
queries for "mycompany.com" always return 1.2.3.4 even if queries in
the upstream DNS would otherwise return a different address. There is
one exception to this: if the upstream DNS contains a CNAME which
points to a shadowed name, then looking up the CNAME through dnsmasq
will result in the unshadowed address associated with the target of
the CNAME. To work around this, add the CNAME to /etc/hosts so that
the CNAME is shadowed too.
<p>
<p>
The network-id system works as follows: For each DHCP request, dnsmasq
collects a set of valid network-id tags, one from the
<b>dhcp-range</b> used to allocate the address, one from any matching
<b>dhcp-host</b> and possibly many from matching vendor classes and user
classes sent by the DHCP client. Any
<b>dhcp-option</b> which has network-id tags will be used in preference  to an untagged
<b>dhcp-option,</b> provided that _all_ the tags match somewhere in the
set collected as described above. The prefix &#146;#&#146; on a tag means &#146;not&#146;
so --dhcp=option=#purple,3,1.2.3.4 sends the option when the
network-id tag purple is not in the set of valid tags.
<p>
If the network-id in a
<b>dhcp-range</b> is prefixed with &#146;net:&#146; then its meaning changes from setting a
tag to matching it. Thus if there is more than dhcp-range on a subnet,
and one is tagged with a network-id which is set (for instance
from a vendorclass option) then hosts which set the netid tag will be
allocated addresses in the tagged range.
<p>
The DHCP server in dnsmasq will function as a BOOTP server also,
provided that the MAC address and IP address for clients are given,
either using
<b>dhcp-host</b> configurations or in
<i>/etc/ethers</i> , and a
<b>dhcp-range</b> configuration option is present to activate the DHCP server
on a particular network. (Setting --bootp-dynamic removes the need for
static address mappings.) The filename
parameter in a BOOTP request is matched against netids in
<b>dhcp-option</b> configurations, as is the tag "bootp", allowing some control over the options returned to
different classes of hosts.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">EXIT CODES</h1>
<p>
0 - Dnsmasq successfully forked into the background, or terminated
normally if backgrounding is not enabled.
<p>
1 - A problem with configuration was detected.
<p>
2 - A problem with network access occurred (address in use, attempt
to use privileged ports without permission).
<p>
3 - A problem occurred with a filesystem operation (missing
file/directory, permissions).
<p>
4 - Memory allocation failure.
<p>
5 - Other miscellaneous problem.
<p>
11 or greater - a non zero return code was received from the
lease-script process "init" call. The exit code from dnsmasq is the
script&#146;s exit code with 10 added.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">LIMITS</h1>
The default values for resource limits in dnsmasq are generally
conservative, and appropriate for embedded router type devices with
slow processors and limited memory. On more capable hardware, it is
possible to increase the limits, and handle many more clients. The
following applies to dnsmasq-2.37: earlier versions did not scale as well.
<p>
<p>
Dnsmasq is capable of handling DNS and DHCP for at least a thousand
clients. Clearly to do this the value of
<b>--dhcp-lease-max</b> must be increased,
and lease times should not be very short (less than one hour). The
value of
<b>--dns-forward-max</b> can be increased: start with it equal to
the number of clients and increase if DNS seems slow. Note that DNS
performance depends too on the performance of the upstream
nameservers. The size of the DNS cache may be increased: the hard
limit is 10000 names and the default (150) is very low. Sending
SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq makes it log information which is useful for tuning
the cache size. See the
<b><a href=#4>NOTES</a></b> section for details.
<p>
<p>
The built-in TFTP server is capable of many simultaneous file
transfers: the absolute limit is related to the number of file-handles
allowed to a process and the ability of the select() system call to
cope with large numbers of file handles. If the limit is set too high
using
<b>--tftp-max</b> it will be scaled down and the actual limit logged at
start-up. Note that more transfers are possible when the same file is
being sent than when each transfer sends a different file.
<p>
<p>
It is possible to use dnsmasq to block Web advertising by using a list
of known banner-ad servers, all resolving to 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, in
<b>/etc/hosts</b> or an additional hosts file. The list can be very long,
dnsmasq has been tested successfully with one million names. That size
file needs a 1GHz processor and about 60Mb of RAM.
