<b>smartctl</b> - Control and Monitor Utility for SMART Disks

<h1 class="manpages">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<b>smartctl [options] device</b> <p>
<h1 class="manpages">FULL PATH</h1>
<b>/usr/sbin/smartctl</b> <p>
<h1 class="manpages">PACKAGE VERSION</h1>
smartmontools-5.38 released 2008/03/10 at 10:44:07 GMT
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<b>smartctl</b> controls the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE and
SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability
of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out
different types of drive self-tests.  This version of <b>smartctl</b>
is compatible with ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards (see REFERENCES
below)
<p>
<b>smartctl</b> is a command line utility designed to perform SMART
tasks such as printing the SMART self-test and error logs, enabling
and disabling SMART automatic testing, and initiating device
self-tests. Note: if the user issues a SMART command that is
(apparently) not implemented by the device, <b>smartctl</b> will print
a warning message but issue the command anyway (see the <b>-T,
--tolerance</b> option below).  This should not cause problems: on
most devices, unimplemented SMART commands issued to a drive are
ignored and/or return an error.
<p>
<b>smartctl</b> also provides support for polling TapeAlert messages
from SCSI tape drives and changers.
<p>
The user must specify the device to be controlled or interrogated as
the final argument to <b>smartctl</b>.  Device paths are as follows:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>
<b>LINUX</b>:
</td><td>
Use the forms <b>"/dev/hd[a-t]"</b> for IDE/ATA
devices, and <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b> for SCSI devices. For
SCSI Tape Drives and Changers with TapeAlert support use the devices
<b>"/dev/nst*"</b> and <b>"/dev/sg*"</b>.
For SATA disks accessed with libata, use <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b>
and append <b>"-d ata"</b>. For disks behind 3ware controllers
you may need <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b> or <b>"/dev/twe[0-9]"</b>
or <b>"/dev/twa[0-9]"</b>: see details below. For disks behind
HighPoint RocketRAID controllers you may need <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b>.
More general paths (such as devfs ones) may also be specified.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>
<b>DARWIN</b>:
</td><td>
Use the forms <b>/dev/disk[0-9]</b> or equivalently <b>disk[0-9]</b> or equivalently
<b>/dev/rdisk[0-9]</b>.  Long forms are also available: please use &#39;-h&#39; to see some
examples. Note that there is currently no Darwin SCSI support.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>

Use the form <b>"/dev/wd[0-9]+c"</b> for IDE/ATA
devices.  For SCSI disk and tape devices, use the device names
<b>"/dev/sd[0-9]+c"</b> and <b>"/dev/st[0-9]+c"</b> respectively. 
Be sure to specify the correct "whole disk" partition letter for
your architecture.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>
<b>SOLARIS</b>:
</td><td>
Use the forms <b>"/dev/rdsk/c?t?d?s?"</b> for IDE/ATA and SCSI disk
devices, and <b>"/dev/rmt/*"</b> for SCSI tape devices.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>
<b>WINDOWS 9x/ME</b>:

Use the forms <b>"/dev/hd[a-d]"</b> for standard IDE/ATA devices
accessed via SMARTVSD.VXD, and <b>"/dev/hd[e-h]"</b> for additional devices
accessed via a patched SMARTVSE.VXD (see INSTALL file for details).
Use the form <b>"/dev/scsi[0-9][0-f]"</b> for SCSI devices via an aspi dll
on ASPI adapter 0-9, ID 0-15. The prefix <b>"/dev/"</b> is optional.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=9%>
<b>WINDOWS NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista</b>:
</td><td>
Use the forms <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b> for IDE/(S)ATA and SCSI disks
"\\.\PhysicalDrive[0-25]" (where "a" maps to "0").
These disks can also be referred to as <b>"/dev/pd[0-255]"</b> for
"\\.\PhysicalDrive[0-255]".
ATA disks can also be referred to as <b>"/dev/hd[a-z]"</b> for
"\\.\PhysicalDrive[0-25]".
Use one the forms <b>"/dev/tape[0-255]"</b>, <b>"/dev/st[0-255]"</b>,
or <b>"/dev/nst[0-255]"</b> for SCSI tape drives "\\.\Tape[0-255]".
<p>
Alternatively, drive letters <b>"X:"</b> or <b>"X:\"</b> may be used to
specify the physical drive behind a mounted partition.
<p>
For disks behind 3ware 9000 controllers use <b>"/dev/sd[a-z],N"</b> where
N specifies the disk number (3ware &#39;port&#39;) behind the controller
providing the logical drive (&#39;unit&#39;) specified by <b>"/dev/sd[a-z]"</b>.
Alternatively, use <b>"/dev/tw_cli/cx/py"</b> for controller x, port y
to run the &#39;tw_cli&#39; tool and parse the output. This provides limited
monitoring (&#39;-i&#39;, &#39;-c&#39;, &#39;-A&#39; below) if SMART support is missing
in the driver. Use <b>"/dev/tw_cli/stdin"</b> or <b>"/dev/tw_cli/clip"</b>
to parse CLI or 3DM output from standard input or clipboard.
The option &#39;-d 3ware,N&#39; is not necessary on Windows.
The prefix <b>"/dev/"</b> is optional.

</table>
if &#39;-&#39; is specified as the device path, <b>smartctl</b> reads and
interprets it&#146;s own debug output from standard input.
See &#39;-r ataioctl&#39; below for details.
<p>
Based on the device path, <b>smartctl</b> will guess the device type
(ATA or SCSI).  If necessary, the &#39;-d&#39; option can be used to over-ride
this guess
<p>
Note that the printed output of <b>smartctl</b> displays most numerical
values in base 10 (decimal), but some values are displayed in base 16
(hexadecimal).  To distinguish them, the base 16 values are always
displayed with a leading <b>"0x"</b>, for example: "0xff". This man
page follows the same convention.
<p>
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS</h1>
<p>
The options are grouped below into several categories.  <b>smartctl</b>
will execute the corresponding commands in the order: INFORMATION,
ENABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.
<p>
SCSI devices only accept the options <b>-h, -V, -i, -a, -A, -d,
-s, -S,-H, -t, -C, -l background, -l error, -l selftest, -r,</b>
and <b>-X</b>.  TapeAlert devices only accept the options <b>-h, -V,
-i, -a, -A, -d, -s, -S, -t, -l error, -l selftest, -r,</b>
and <b>-H</b>.
<p>
Long options  are  not  supported  on  all  systems.   Use
<b>&#39;smartctl -h&#39;</b> to see the available options.

<p>
<i>silent</i> - print no output.  The only way to learn about what was found is to
use the exit status of <b>smartctl</b> (see RETURN VALUES below).
<p>
<i>noserial</i> - Do not print the serial number of the device.
<p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>-d TYPE, --device=TYPE</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies the type of the device.  The valid arguments to this option
are <i>ata</i>, <i>scsi</i>, <i>sat</i>, <i>marvell</i>, <i>3ware,N</i>, and <i>hpt,L/M</i>,
<i>cciss,N</i> or <i>hpt,L/M/N</i>.  If this option is not used then
<b>smartctl</b> will attempt to guess the device type from the device name.
<p>
The &#39;sat&#39; device type is for ATA disks that have a SCSI to ATA
Translation (SAT) Layer (SATL) between the disk and the operating system.
SAT defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI commands, one 12 bytes long and
the other 16 bytes long that <b>smartctl</b> will utilize when this device
type is selected. The default is the 16 byte variant which can be
overridden with either &#39;-d sat,12&#39; or &#39;-d sat,16&#39;.
<p>
Under Linux, to look at SATA disks behind Marvell SATA controllers
(using Marvell&#146;s &#39;linuxIAL&#39; driver rather than libata driver) use &#39;-d marvell&#39;. Such
controllers show up as Marvell Technology Group Ltd. SATA I or II controllers
using lspci, or using lspci -n show a vendor ID 0x11ab and a device ID of
either 0x5040, 0x5041, 0x5080, 0x5081, 0x6041 or 0x6081. The &#39;linuxIAL&#39; driver
seems not (yet?) available in the Linux kernel source tree, but should be available
from system vendors (<a href="ftp://ftp.aslab.com/">ftp://ftp.aslab.com/</a> is known to provide a patch with the driver).
<p>
Under Linux and FreeBSD, to look at ATA disks behind 3ware SCSI RAID controllers,
use syntax such as:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/sda</b>
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0</b>
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<b>smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0</b>
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
where in the argument <i>3ware,N</i>, the integer N is the disk number
(3ware &#39;port&#39;) within the 3ware ATA RAID controller.  The allowed
values of N are from 0 to 31 inclusive.  The first two forms, which
refer to devices /dev/sda-z and /dev/twe0-15, may be used with 3ware
series 6000, 7000, and 8000 series controllers that use the 3x-xxxx
driver.  <b>Note that the /dev/sda-z form is deprecated</b> starting
with the Linux 2.6 kernel series and may not be supported by the Linux
kernel in the near future. The final form, which refers to devices
/dev/twa0-15, must be used with 3ware 9000 series controllers, which
use the 3w-9xxx driver.
<p>
Note that if the special character device nodes /dev/twa? and
/dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the incorrect major or minor
numbers, smartctl will recreate them on the fly.  Typically /dev/twa0
refers to the first 9000-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the
second 9000 series controller, and so on. Likewise /dev/twe0 refers to
the first 6/7/8000-series controller, /dev/twa1 refers to the second
6/7/8000 series controller, and so on.
<p>
Note that for the 6/7/8000 controllers, <b>any</b> of the physical
disks can be queried or examined using <b>any</b> of the 3ware&#146;s SCSI
logical device /dev/sd?  entries.  Thus, if logical device /dev/sda is
made up of two physical disks (3ware ports zero and one) and logical
device /dev/sdb is made up of two other physical disks (3ware ports
two and three) then you can examine the SMART data on <b>any</b> of the
four physical disks using <b>either</b> SCSI device /dev/sda <b>or</b>
/dev/sdb.  If you need to know which logical SCSI device a particular
physical disk (3ware port) is associated with, use the dmesg or SYSLOG
output to show which SCSI ID corresponds to a particular 3ware unit,
and then use the 3ware CLI or 3dm tool to determine which ports
(physical disks) correspond to particular 3ware units.
<p>
If the value of N corresponds to a port that does <b>not</b> exist on
the 3ware controller, or to a port that does not physically have a
disk attached to it, the behavior of <b>smartctl</b> depends upon the
specific controller model, firmware, Linux kernel and platform.  In
some cases you will get a warning message that the device does not
exist. In other cases you will be presented with &#39;void&#39; data for a
non-existent device.
<p>
Note that if the /dev/sd? addressing form is used, then older 3w-xxxx
drivers do not pass the "Enable Autosave"
(&#39;<b>-S on</b>&#39;) and "Enable Automatic Offline" (&#39;<b>-o on</b>&#39;)
commands to the disk, and produce these types of harmless syslog error
messages instead: "<b>3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru size (123392) too
big</b>". This can be fixed by upgrading to version 1.02.00.037 or
later of the 3w-xxxx driver, or by applying a patch to older
versions. See <b><a href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/">http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net</a>/</b> for
instructions.  Alternatively, use the character device /dev/twe0-15 interface.
<p>
The selective self-test functions (&#39;-t select,A-B&#39;) are only supported
using the character device interface /dev/twa0-15 and /dev/twe0-15.
The necessary WRITE LOG commands can not be passed through the SCSI
interface.

The behavior of <b>smartctl</b> depends upon whether the command is
"<b>optional</b>" or "<b>mandatory</b>". Here "<b>mandatory</b>" means
"required by the ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification if the device implements
the SMART command set" and "<b>optional</b>" means "not required by the
ATA/ATAPI-5 Specification even if the device implements the SMART
command set."  The "<b>mandatory</b>" ATA and SMART commands are: (1)
ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE, (2) SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE, (3)
SMART ENABLE/DISABLE, and (4) SMART RETURN STATUS.
<p>
The valid arguments to this option are:
<p>
<i>normal</i> - exit on failure of any <b>mandatory</b> SMART command, and ignore
all failures of <b>optional</b> SMART commands.  This is the default.
Note that on some devices, issuing unimplemented optional SMART
commands doesn&#39;t cause an error.  This can result in misleading
<b>smartctl</b> messages such as "Feature X not implemented", followed
shortly by "Feature X: enabled".  In most such cases, contrary to the
final message, Feature X is <b>not</b> enabled.
<p>
<i>conservative</i> - exit on failure of any <b>optional</b> SMART command.
<p>
<i>permissive</i> - ignore failure(s) of <b>mandatory</b> SMART commands.  This option
may be given more than once.  Each additional use of this option will
cause one more additional failure to be ignored.  Note that the use of
this option can lead to messages like "Feature X not implemented",
followed shortly by "Error: unable to enable Feature X".  In a few
such cases, contrary to the final message, Feature X <b>is</b> enabled.

When used just once, it shows a record of the ioctl() transactions

ioctl() transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid
arguments to this option are:
<p>
<i>ioctl</i> - report all ioctl() transactions.
<p>
<i>ataioctl</i> - report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.
<p>
<i>scsiioctl</i> - report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices. Invoking this once
shows the SCSI commands in hex and the corresponding status. Invoking
it a second time adds a hex listing of the first 64 bytes of data send to,

<p>
Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level of detail
that should be reported.  The argument should be followed by a comma then
the integer with no spaces.  For example,

Enables or disables SMART automatic offline test, which scans the drive
every four hours for disk defects. This command can be given during normal
system operation.  The valid arguments to this option are <i>on</i>
and <i>off</i>.
<p>
Note that the SMART automatic offline test command is listed as
"Obsolete" in every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI Specifications.
It was originally part of the SFF-8035i Revision 2.0 specification,
but was never part of any ATA specification.  However it is
implemented and used by many vendors. [Good documentation can be found
in IBM&#39;s Official Published Disk Specifications.  For example the IBM
Travelstar 40GNX Hard Disk Drive Specifications (Revision 1.1, 22
April 2002, Publication # 1541, Document S07N-7715-02) page 164. You
can also read the SFF-8035i Specification -- see REFERENCES below.]
You can tell if automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if
this command enables and disables it, as indicated by the &#39;Auto
Offline Data Collection&#39; part of the SMART capabilities report
(displayed with &#39;-c&#39;).
<p>
SMART provides <b>three</b> basic categories of testing.  The
<b>first</b> category, called "online" testing, has no effect on the
performance of the device.  It is turned on by the &#39;-s on&#39; option.
<p>
The <b>second</b> category of testing is called "offline" testing. This
type of test can, in principle, degrade the device performance.  The
&#39;-o on&#39; option causes this offline testing to be carried out,
automatically, on a regular scheduled basis.  Normally, the disk will
suspend offline testing while disk accesses are taking place, and then
automatically resume it when the disk would otherwise be idle, so in
practice it has little effect.  Note that a one-time offline test can
also be carried out immediately upon receipt of a user command.  See
the &#39;-t offline&#39; option below, which causes a one-time offline test
to be carried out immediately.
<p>
The choice (made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors) of
the word <i>testing</i> for these first two categories is unfortunate,
and often leads to confusion.  In fact these first two categories of
online and offline testing could have been more accurately described
as online and offline <b>data collection</b>.
<p>
The results of this automatic or immediate offline testing (data
collection) are reflected in the values of the SMART Attributes.
Thus, if problems or errors are detected, the values of these
Attributes will go below their failure thresholds; some types of
errors may also appear in the SMART error log. These are visible with
the &#39;-A&#39; and &#39;-l error&#39; options respectively.
<p>
Some SMART attribute values are updated only during off-line data
collection activities; the rest are updated during normal operation of
the device or during both normal operation and off-line testing.  The
Attribute value table produced by the &#39;-A&#39; option indicates this in
the UPDATED column.  Attributes of the first type are labeled
"Offline" and Attributes of the second type are labeled "Always".
<p>
The <b>third</b> category of testing (and the <i>only</i> category for
which the word &#39;testing&#39; is really an appropriate choice) is "self"
testing.  This third type of test is only performed (immediately) when
a command to run it is issued.  The &#39;-t&#39; and &#39;-X&#39; options can be
used to carry out and abort such self-tests; please see below for
further details.
<p>
Any errors detected in the self testing will be shown in the
SMART self-test log, which can be examined using the &#39;-l selftest&#39;
option.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> in this manual page, the word <b>"Test"</b> is used in
connection with the second category just described, e.g. for the
"offline" testing.  The words <b>"Self-test"</b> are used in
connection with the third category.

For SCSI devices this toggles the value of the Global Logging Target
Save Disabled (GLTSD) bit in the Control Mode Page. Some disk
manufacturers set this bit by default. This prevents error counters,
power-up hours and other useful data from being placed in non-volatile
storage, so these values may be reset to zero the next time the device
is power-cycled.  If the GLTSD bit is set then &#39;smartctl -a&#39; will

<b>-A, --attributes</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Prints only the vendor specific SMART Attributes.  The Attributes are
numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific names and ID numbers. For
example Attribute 12 is "power cycle count": how many times has the
disk been powered up.
<p>
Each Attribute has a "Raw" value, printed under the heading
"RAW_VALUE", and a "Normalized" value printed under the heading
"VALUE".  [Note: <b>smartctl</b> prints these values in base-10.]  In
the example just given, the "Raw Value" for Attribute 12 would be the
actual number of times that the disk has been power-cycled, for
example 365 if the disk has been turned on once per day for exactly
one year.  Each vendor uses their own algorithm to convert this "Raw"
value to a "Normalized" value in the range from 1 to 254.  Please keep
in mind that <b>smartctl</b> only reports the different Attribute
types, values, and thresholds as read from the device.  It does
<b>not</b> carry out the conversion between "Raw" and "Normalized"
values: this is done by the disk&#39;s firmware.
<p>
The conversion from Raw value to a quantity with physical units is
not specified by the SMART standard. In most cases, the values printed
by <b>smartctl</b> are sensible.  For example the temperature Attribute
generally has its raw value equal to the temperature in Celsius.
However in some cases vendors use unusual conventions.  For example
the Hitachi disk on my laptop reports its power-on hours in minutes,
not hours. Some IBM disks track three temperatures rather than one, in
their raw values.  And so on.
<p>
Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255)
which is printed under the heading "THRESH".  If the Normalized value
is <b>less than or equal to</b> the Threshold value, then the Attribute
is said to have failed.  If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute,
then disk failure is imminent.
<p>
Each Attribute also has a "Worst" value shown under the heading
"WORST".  This is the smallest (closest to failure) value that the
disk has recorded at any time during its lifetime when SMART was
enabled.  [Note however that some vendors firmware may actually
<b>increase</b> the "Worst" value for some "rate-type" Attributes.]
<p>
The Attribute table printed out by <b>smartctl</b> also shows the
"TYPE" of the Attribute. Attributes are one of two possible types:
Pre-failure or Old age.  Pre-failure Attributes are ones which, if
less than or equal to their threshold values, indicate pending disk
failure.  Old age, or usage Attributes, are ones which indicate
end-of-product life from old-age or normal aging and wearout, if
the Attribute value is less than or equal to the threshold.  <b>Please
note</b>: the fact that an Attribute is of type &#146;Pre-fail&#146; does
<b>not</b> mean that your disk is about to fail!  It only has this
meaning if the Attribute&#39;s current Normalized value is less than or
equal to the threshold value.
<p>
If the Attribute&#39;s current Normalized value is less than or equal to
the threshold value, then the "WHEN_FAILED" column will display
"FAILING_NOW". If not, but the worst recorded value is less than or
equal to the threshold value, then this column will display
"In_the_past".  If the "WHEN_FAILED" column has no entry (indicated by
a dash: &#39;-&#39;) then this Attribute is OK now (not failing) and has
also never failed in the past.
<p>
The table column labeled "UPDATED" shows if the SMART Attribute values
are updated during both normal operation and off-line testing, or
only during offline testing.  The former are labeled "Always" and the
latter are labeled "Offline".
<p>
So to summarize: the Raw Attribute values are the ones that might have
a real physical interpretation, such as "Temperature Celsius",
"Hours", or "Start-Stop Cycles".  Each manufacturer converts these,
using their detailed knowledge of the disk&#39;s operations and failure
modes, to Normalized Attribute values in the range 1-254.  The
current and worst (lowest measured) of these Normalized Attribute
values are stored on the disk, along with a Threshold value that the
manufacturer has determined will indicate that the disk is going to
fail, or that it has exceeded its design age or aging limit.
<b>smartctl</b> does <b>not</b> calculate any of the Attribute values,
thresholds, or types, it merely reports them from the SMART data on
the device.
<p>
Note that starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of these
Attribute fields has been made entirely vendor-specific.  However most
ATA/ATAPI-5 disks seem to respect their meaning, so we have retained
the option of printing the Attribute values.
<p>
For SCSI devices the "attributes" are obtained from the temperature
and start-stop cycle counter log pages. Certain vendor specific
attributes are listed if recognised. The attributes are output in a
relatively free format (compared with ATA disk attributes).

In addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the error are

Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is the number of days, HH is hours, MM is
minutes, SS is seconds and msec is milliseconds.  [Note: this time
stamp wraps after 2^32 milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours 2 minutes and
47.296 seconds.]  The key ATA disk registers are also recorded in the
log.  The final column of the error log is a text-string description
of the ATA command defined by the Command Register (CR) and Feature
Register (FR) values.  Commands that are obsolete in the most current
(ATA-7) spec are listed like this: <b>READ LONG (w/ retry) [OBS-4]</b>,
indicating that the command became obsolete with or in the ATA-4
specification.  Similarly, the notation <b>[RET-</b><i>N</i><b>]</b> is
used to indicate that a command was retired in the ATA-<i>N</i>
specification.  Some commands are not defined in any version of the
ATA specification but are in common use nonetheless; these are marked
<b>[NS]</b>, meaning non-standard.
<p>
The ATA Specification (ATA-5 Revision 1c, Section 8.41.6.8.2) says:
<b>"Error log structures shall include UNC errors, IDNF errors for
which the address requested was valid, servo errors, write fault
errors, etc.  Error log data structures shall not include errors
attributed to the receipt of faulty commands such as command codes not
implemented by the device or requests with invalid parameters or
invalid addresses."</b> The definitions of these terms are:
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>UNC</b> (<b>UNC</b>orrectable): data is uncorrectable.  This refers
to data which has been read from the disk, but for which the Error
Checking and Correction (ECC) codes are inconsistent.  In effect, this
means that the data can not be read.
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>IDNF</b> (<b>ID N</b>ot <b>F</b>ound): user-accessible address could
not be found. For READ LOG type commands, <b>IDNF</b> can also indicate
that a device data log structure checksum was incorrect.
<p>
If the command that caused the error was a READ or WRITE command, then
the Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the error occurred will be
printed in base 10 and base 16.  The LBA is a linear address, which
counts 512-byte sectors on the disk, starting from zero.  (Because of
the limitations of the SMART error log, if the LBA is greater than
0xfffffff, then either no error log entry will be made, or the error
log entry will have an incorrect LBA. This may happen for drives with
a capacity greater than 128 GiB or 137 GB.) On Linux systems the
smartmontools web page has instructions about how to convert the LBA
address to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous disk
sector.
<p>
Please note that some manufacturers <b>ignore</b> the ATA
specifications, and make entries in the error log if the device
receives a command which is not implemented or is not valid.
<p>
<i>error [SCSI]</i> - prints the error counter log pages for reads, write and verifies.
The verify row is only output if it has an element other than zero.
<p>
<i>selftest</i> - prints the SMART self-test log.  The disk maintains a self-test log
showing the results of the self tests, which can be run using the
&#39;-t&#39; option described below.  For each of the most recent
twenty-one self-tests, the log shows the type of test (short or
extended, off-line or captive) and the final status of the test.  If
the test did not complete successfully, then the percentage of the
test remaining is shown.  The time at which the test took place,
measured in hours of disk lifetime, is also printed.  If any errors
were detected, the Logical Block Address (LBA) of the first error is
printed in decimal notation. On Linux systems the smartmontools
web page has instructions about how to convert this LBA address to the
name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.
<p>
<i>selftest [SCSI]</i> - the self-test log for a SCSI device has a slightly different format
than for an ATA device.  For each of the most recent twenty
self-tests, it shows the type of test and the status (final or in
progress) of the test. SCSI standards use the terms "foreground" and
"background" (rather than ATA&#39;s corresponding "captive" and
"off-line") and "short" and "long" (rather than ATA&#39;s corresponding
"short" and "extended") to describe the type of the test.  The printed
segment number is only relevant when a test fails in the third or
later test segment.  It identifies the test that failed and consists
of either the number of the segment that failed during the test, or
the number of the test that failed and the number of the segment in
which the test was run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both
numbers into a single byte.  The Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
first error is printed in hexadecimal notation.  On Linux systems the
smartmontools web page has instructions about how to convert this LBA
address to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous block.
If provided, the SCSI Sense Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC) and
Additional Sense Code Qualifier (ASQ) are also printed. The self tests

<i>selective [ATA]</i> - Some ATA-7 disks (example: Maxtor) also maintain a selective

shows the start/end Logical Block Addresses (LBA) of each of the five
test spans, and their current test status.  If the span is being
tested or the remainder of the disk is being read-scanned, the
current 65536-sector block of LBAs being tested is also displayed.
The selective self-test log also shows if a read-scan of the
remainder of the disk will be carried out after the selective
self-test has completed (see &#39;-t afterselect&#39; option) and the time
delay before restarting this read-scan if it is interrupted (see
&#39;-t pending&#39; option). This is a new smartmontools feature; please
report unusual or incorrect behavior to the smartmontools-support
mailing list.
<p>
<i>directory</i> - if the device supports the General Purpose Logging feature set
(ATA-6 and ATA-7 only) then this prints the Log Directory (the log at
address 0).  The Log Directory shows what logs are available and their
length in sectors (512 bytes).  The contents of the logs at address 1
[Summary SMART error log] and at address 6 [SMART self-test log] may
be printed using the previously-described
<i>error</i> and
<i>selftest</i> arguments to this option. [Please note: this is a new, experimental
feature.  We would like to add support for printing the contents of
extended and comprehensive SMART self-test and error logs.  If your
disk supports these, and you would like to assist, please contact the
<b>smartmontools</b> developers.]
<p>
<i>background [SCSI]</i> - the background scan results log outputs information derived from
Background Media Scans (BMS) done after power up and/or periodocally (e.g.
every 24 hours) on recent SCSI disks. If supported, the BMS status
is output first, indicating whether a background scan is currently
underway (and if so a progress percentage), the amount of time the disk
has been powered up and the number of scans already completed. Then there
is a header and a line for each background scan "event". These will
typically be either recovered or unrecoverable errors. That latter group
may need some attention. There is a description of the background scan
mechansim in section 4.18 of SBC-3 revision 6 (see www.t10.org ).
<p>
<i>scttemp, scttempsts, scttemphist [ATA]</i> - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints the disk temperature
information provided by the SMART Command Transport (SCT) commands.
The option &#39;scttempsts&#39; prints current temperature and temperature
ranges returned by the SCT Status command, &#39;scttemphist&#39; prints
temperature limits and the temperature history table returned by
the SCT Data Table command, and &#39;scttemp&#39; prints both.
The temperature values are preserved across power cycles.
The default temperature logging interval is 1 minute and can be
configured with the &#39;-t scttempint,N[,p]&#39; option, see below.
The SCT commands are specified in the proposed ATA-8 Command Set
(ACS), and are already implemented in some recent ATA-7 disks.

<p>
<i>9,temp</i> - Raw Attribute number 9 is the disk temperature in Celsius.
<p>
<i>192,emergencyretractcyclect</i> - Raw Attribute number 192 is the Emergency Retract Cycle Count.
<p>
<i>193,loadunload</i> - Raw Attribute number 193 contains two values. The first is the
number of load cycles.  The second is the number of unload cycles.
The difference between these two values is the number of times that
the drive was unexpectedly powered off (also called an emergency
unload). As a rule of thumb, the mechanical stress created by one
emergency unload is equivalent to that created by one hundred normal
unloads.
<p>
<i>194,10xCelsius</i> - Raw Attribute number 194 is ten times the disk temperature in
Celsius.  This is used by some Samsung disks (example: model SV1204H
with RK100-13 firmware).
<p>
<i>194,unknown</i> - Raw Attribute number 194 is NOT the disk temperature, and its

Modifies the behavior of <b>smartctl</b> to compensate for some known
and understood device firmware or driver bug.  Except &#39;swapid&#39;,
the arguments to this option are exclusive, so that only the final
option given is used.  The valid values are:
<p>
<i>none</i> - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA specifications.  This
is the default, unless the device has presets for &#39;-F&#39; in the
device database (see note below).
<p>
<i>samsung</i> - In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H Firmware Version:
RM100-08) some of the two- and four-byte quantities in the SMART data
structures are byte-swapped (relative to the ATA specification).
Enabling this option tells <b>smartctl</b> to evaluate these quantities
in byte-reversed order.  Some signs that your disk needs this option
are (1) no self-test log printed, even though you have run self-tests;
(2) very large numbers of ATA errors reported in the ATA error log;
(3) strange and impossible values for the ATA error log timestamps.
<p>
<i>samsung2</i> - In more recent Samsung disks (firmware revisions ending in "-23")
the number of ATA errors reported is byte swapped.  Enabling this
option tells <b>smartctl</b> to evaluate this quantity in
byte-reversed order. An indication that your Samsung disk needs this
option is that the self-test log is printed correctly, but there are a
very large number of errors in the SMART error log.  This is because
the error count is byte swapped.  Thus a disk with five errors
(0x0005) will appear to have 20480 errors (0x5000).
<p>
<i>samsung3</i> - Some Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with Firmware VF100-37) report
a self-test still in progress with 0% remaining when the test was already
completed. Enabling this option modifies the output of the self-test
execution status (see options &#39;-c&#39; or &#39;-a&#39; above) accordingly.
<p>
Note that an explicit &#39;-F&#39; option on the command line will
over-ride any preset values for &#39;-F&#39; (see the &#39;-P&#39; option
below).

Specifies whether <b>smartctl</b> should use any preset options that
are available for this drive. By default, if the drive is recognized
in the <b>smartmontools</b> database, then the presets are used.
<p>
<b>smartctl</b> can automatically set appropriate options for known
drives.  For example, the Maxtor 4D080H4 uses Attribute 9 to stores
power-on time in minutes whereas most drives use that Attribute to
store the power-on time in hours.  The command-line option &#39;-v
9,minutes&#39; ensures that <b>smartctl</b> correctly interprets Attribute
9 in this case, but that option is preset for the Maxtor 4D080H4 and
so need not be specified by the user on the <b>smartctl</b> command
line.
<p>
The argument
<i>show</i> will show any preset options for your drive and the argument
<i>showall</i> will show all known drives in the <b>smartmontools</b> database, along
with their preset options.  If there are no presets for your drive and
you think there should be (for example, a -v or -F option is needed
to get <b>smartctl</b> to display correct values) then please contact
the <b>smartmontools</b> developers so that this information can be
added to the <b>smartmontools</b> database.  Contact information is at the
end of this man page.
<p>
The valid arguments to this option are:
<p>
<i>use</i> - if a drive is recognized, then use the stored presets for it.  This
is the default. Note that presets will NOT over-ride additional
Attribute interpretation (&#39;-v N,something&#39;) command-line options or
explicit &#39;-F&#39; command-line options..
<p>
<i>ignore</i> - do not use presets.

<i>show</i> - show if the drive is recognized in the database, and if so, its
presets, then exit.
<p>
<i>showall</i> - list all recognized drives, and the presets that are set for them,

Executes TEST immediately.  The &#39;-C&#39; option can be used in
conjunction with this option to run the short or long (and also for
ATA devices, selective or conveyance) self-tests in captive mode
(known as "foreground mode" for SCSI devices).  Note that only one
test type can be run at a time, so only one test type should be
specified per command line.  Note also that if a computer is shutdown
or power cycled during a self-test, no harm should result.  The
self-test will either be aborted or will resume automatically.
<p>
The valid arguments to this option are: 
<p>
<i>offline</i> - runs SMART Immediate Offline Test.  This immediately
starts the test described above.  This command can be given during
normal system operation.  The effects of this test are visible only in
that it updates the SMART Attribute values, and if errors are
found they will appear in the SMART error log, visible with the &#39;-l error&#39;
option. [In the case of SCSI devices runs the default self test in
foreground. No entry is placed in the self test log.]
<p>
If the &#39;-c&#39; option to <b>smartctl</b> shows that the device has the
"Suspend Offline collection upon new command" capability then you can
track the progress of the Immediate Offline test using the &#39;-c&#39;
option to <b>smartctl</b>.  If the &#39;-c&#39; option show that the device
has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability then
most commands will abort the Immediate Offline Test, so you should not
try to track the progress of the test with &#39;-c&#39;, as it will abort
the test.
<p>
<i>short</i> - runs SMART Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the "Background short" self-test.]
This command can be given during normal system operation (unless run in
captive mode - see the &#39;-C&#39; option below).  This is a
test in a different category than the immediate or automatic offline
tests.  The "Self" tests check the electrical and mechanical
performance as well as the read performance of the disk.  Their
results are reported in the Self Test Error Log, readable with
the &#39;-l selftest&#39; option.  Note that on some disks the progress of the
self-test can be monitored by watching this log during the self-test; with other disks
use the &#39;-c&#39; option to monitor progress.
<p>
<i>long</i> - runs SMART Extended Self Test (tens of minutes).
[Note: in the case of SCSI devices,
this command option runs the "Background long" self-test.]
This is a
longer and more thorough version of the Short Self Test described
above.  Note that this command can be given during normal
system operation (unless run in captive mode - see the &#39;-C&#39; option below).
<p>
<i>conveyance</i> - [ATA ONLY] runs a SMART Conveyance Self Test (minutes).  This
self-test routine is intended to identify damage incurred during
transporting of the device. This self-test routine should take on the
order of minutes to complete.  Note that this command can be given
during normal system operation (unless run in captive mode - see the
&#39;-C&#39; option below).
<p>
<i>select,N-M, select,N+SIZE</i> - [ATA ONLY] [EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] runs a SMART
Selective Self Test, to test a <b>range</b> of disk Logical Block
Addresses (LBAs), rather than the entire disk.  Each range of LBAs
that is checked is called a "span" and is specified by a starting LBA
(N) and an ending LBA (M) with N less than or equal to M. The range
can also be specified as N+SIZE. A span at the end of a disk can
be specified by N-<b>max</b>.
<p>
For example the commands:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10+11 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
both runs a self test on one span consisting of LBAs ten to twenty
(inclusive). The command:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,100000000-max /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end of the disk.
The &#39;-t&#39; option can be given up to five times, to test
up to five spans.  For example the command:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-100 -t select,1000-2000 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
runs a self test on two spans.  The first span consists of 101 LBAs
and the second span consists of 1001 LBAs.  Note that the spans can
overlap partially or completely, for example:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-10 -t select,5-15 -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
The results of the selective self-test can be obtained (both during
and after the test) by printing the SMART self-test log, using the
&#39;-l selftest&#39; option to smartctl.
<p>
Selective self tests are particularly useful as disk capacities
increase: an extended self test (smartctl -t long) can take several
hours.  Selective self-tests are helpful if (based on SYSLOG error
messages, previous failed self-tests, or SMART error log entries) you
suspect that a disk is having problems at a particular range of
Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).
<p>
Selective self-tests can be run during normal system operation (unless
done in captive mode - see the &#39;-C&#39; option below).
<p>
[Note: To use this feature on Linux, the kernel must be compiled with
the configuration option CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO enabled.  Please report
unusual or incorrect behavior to the smartmontools-support mailing list.]
<p>
The following variants of the selective self-test command use spans based
on the ranges from past tests already stored on the disk:
<p>
<i>select,redo[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA ONLY] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] redo the last SMART
Selective Self Test using the same LBA range. The starting LBA is identical
to the LBA used by last test, same for ending LBA unless a new span size
is specified by optional +SIZE argument.
<p>
For example the commands:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,redo /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,redo+20 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
have the same effect as:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,10-29 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<i>select,next[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA ONLY] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] runs a SMART Selective
Self Test on the LBA range which follows the range of the last test. The
starting LBA is set to (ending LBA +1) of the last test. A new span size
may be specified by the optional +SIZE argument.
<p>
For example the commands:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,next /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,next+2000 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
have the same effect as:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
  smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,1000-1999 /dev/hda
  smartctl -t select,2000-3999 /dev/hda
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If the last test ended at the last LBA of the disk, the new range starts
at LBA 0. The span size of the last span of a disk is adjusted such that
the total number of spans to check the full disk will not be changed
by future uses of &#39;-t select,next&#39;.
<p>
<i>select,cont[+SIZE]</i> - [ATA ONLY] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] performs a &#39;redo&#39;
(above) if the self test status reports that the last test was aborted
by the host. Otherwise it run the &#39;next&#39; (above) test.
<p>
<i>afterselect,on</i> - [ATA ONLY] perform an offline read scan after a Selective Self-test
has completed. This option must be used together with one or more of
the <i>select,N-M</i> options above. If the LBAs that have been
specified in the Selective self-test pass the test with no errors
found, then read scan the <b>remainder</b> of the disk.  If the device
is powered-cycled while this read scan is in progress, the read scan
will be automatically resumed after a time specified by the pending
timer (see below).  The value of this option is preserved between
selective self-tests.
<p>
<i>afterselect,off</i> - [ATA ONLY] do not read scan the remainder of the disk after a
Selective self-test has completed.  This option must be use together
with one or more of the <i>select,N-M</i> options above.  The value of this
option is preserved between selective self-tests.
<p>
<i>pending,N</i> - [ATA ONLY] set the pending offline read scan timer to N minutes.
Here N is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535 inclusive.  If the
device is powered off during a read scan after a Selective self-test,
then resume the test automatically N minutes after power-up.  This
option must be use together with one or more of the <i>select,N-M</i>
options above. The value of this option is preserved between selective
self-tests.
<p>
<i>scttempint,N[,p]</i> - [ATA ONLY] [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] set the time interval
for SCT temperature logging to N minutes. If &#39;,p&#39; is specified, the
setting is preserved across power cycles. Otherwise, the setting is
volatile and will be reverted to default (1 minute), or last
non-volatile setting by the next hard reset. This command also clears
the temperature history table. See &#39;-l scttemp&#39; above for more
information about SCT temperature logging.

first channel of the first HighPoint RocketRAID controller card.

Run a selective self-test on LBAs 10 to 100 and 30 to 300.  After the
these LBAs have been tested, read-scan the remainder of the disk.  If the disk is
power-cycled during the read-scan, resume the scan 45 minutes after power to the
device is restored.

Examine all SMART data for the first SCSI disk connected to a cciss
RAID controller card.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">RETURN VALUES</h1>
The return values of <b>smartctl</b> are defined by a bitmask.  If all
is well with the disk, the return value (exit status) of
<b>smartctl</b> is 0 (all bits turned off).  If a problem occurs, or an
error, potential error, or fault is detected, then a non-zero status
is returned.  In this case, the eight different bits in the return
value have the following meanings for ATA disks; some of these values
may also be returned for SCSI disks.
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 0:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Command line did not parse.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 1:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Device open failed, or device did not return an IDENTIFY DEVICE structure.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 2:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Some SMART command to the disk failed, or there was a checksum error
in a SMART data structure (see &#39;-b&#39; option above).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 3:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
SMART status check returned "DISK FAILING".
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 4:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
We found prefail Attributes &lt;= threshold.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 5:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
SMART status check returned "DISK OK" but we found that some (usage
or prefail) Attributes have been &lt;= threshold at some time in the
past.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 6:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
The device error log contains records of errors.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>Bit 7:</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
The device self-test log contains records of errors.
<p>
To test within the shell for whether or not the different bits are
turned on or off, you can use the following type of construction (this
is bash syntax):
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<b>smartstat=$(($? & 8))</b> 
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
This looks at only at bit 3 of the exit status
<b>$?</b> (since 8=2^3).  The shell variable
$smartstat will be nonzero if SMART status check returned "disk
failing" and zero otherwise.

The TapeAlert log page flags are cleared for the initiator when the
page is read. This means that each alert condition is reported only
once by <b>smartctl</b> for each initiator for each activation of the
condition.

This code was derived from the smartsuite package, written by Michael
Cornwell, and from the previous UCSC smartsuite package.  It extends
these to cover ATA-5 disks.  This code was originally developed as a
Senior Thesis by Michael Cornwell at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory
(now part of the Storage Systems Research Center), Jack Baskin School
of Engineering, University of California, Santa

REFERENCES FOR SMART
An introductory article about smartmontools is <i>Monitoring Hard
Disks with SMART</i>, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004,
pages 74-77. This is <b><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php</a>?sid=6983</b>
online.
<p>
If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it
does, a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first
volume of the &#39;AT Attachment with Packet Interface-7&#39; (ATA/ATAPI-7)
specification.  This documents the SMART functionality which the
<b>smartmontools</b> utilities provide access to.  You can find
Revision 4b of this document at
<b><a href="http://www.t13.org/docs2004/d1532v1r4b-ATA-ATAPI-7.pdf">http://www.t13.org/docs2004/d1532v1r4b-ATA-ATAPI-7.pdf</a></b> .
Earlier and later versions of this Specification are available from
the T13 web site <b><a href="http://www.t13.org/">http://www.t13.org</a>/</b> .
<p>
The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i
revision 2 and the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications.  These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.  Links to
these documents may be found in the References section of the
<b>smartmontools</b> home page at
