<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<b>ssh</b>
(SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for
executing commands on a remote machine.
It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh,
and provide secure encrypted communications between
two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.
X11 connections and arbitrary TCP ports
can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
<p>
<b>ssh</b>
connects and logs into the specified
<i> hostname</i>
(with optional
<i> user</i>
name).
The user must prove
his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods
depending on the protocol version used (see below).
<p>
If
<i> command</i>
is specified,
it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.
<p>
The options are as follows:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

<tr valign="top"><td>-<b>1</b> 
</td><td>

<tr valign="top"><td>-<b>A</b>

Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.
<p>
Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.
Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
(for the agent&#146;s Unix-domain socket)
can access the local agent through the forwarded connection.
An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,
however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to
authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>-<b>a</b>

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">-<b>b</b> <i> bind_address</i>

Only useful on systems with more than one address.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>-<b>C</b> 
</td><td>
Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and
data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).
The compression algorithm is the same used by
<b>gzip</b>(1),
and the
"level"
can be controlled by the
<b> CompressionLevel</b>
option for protocol version 1.
Compression is desirable on modem lines and other
slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.
The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the
configuration files; see the
<b> Compression</b>
option.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">-<b>c</b> <i> cipher_spec</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.
<p>
Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.
The supported values are
"3des",
"blowfish",
and
"des".
<i> 3des</i>
(triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three different keys.
It is believed to be secure.
<i> blowfish</i>
is a fast block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
<i> 3des</i>.
<i> des</i>
is only supported in the
<b>ssh</b>
client for interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations
that do not support the
<i> 3des</i>
cipher.
Its use is strongly discouraged due to cryptographic weaknesses.
The default is
"3des".
<p>
For protocol version 2,
<i> cipher_spec</i>
is a comma-separated list of ciphers
listed in order of preference.
The supported ciphers are:
3des-cbc,
aes128-cbc,
aes192-cbc,
aes256-cbc,
aes128-ctr,
aes192-ctr,
aes256-ctr,
arcfour128,
arcfour256,
arcfour,
blowfish-cbc,
and
cast128-cbc.
The default is:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">

<br />.Sm off
[<i>bind_address:]</i>

</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies a local
"dynamic"
application-level port forwarding.
This works by allocating a socket to listen to
<i> port</i>
on the local side, optionally bound to the specified
<i> bind_address</i>.
Whenever a connection is made to this port, the
connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application
protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the
remote machine.
Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and
<b>ssh</b>
will act as a SOCKS server.
Only root can forward privileged ports.
Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.
<p>
IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax:
<br />.Sm off
<br />.Xo 
[<i>bind_address /</i>]
<i> port</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
<br />.Sm on
or by enclosing the address in square brackets.
Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
<b> GatewayPorts</b>
setting.
However, an explicit
<i> bind_address</i>
may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.
The
<i> bind_address</i>
of
"localhost"
indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
empty address or
&#39;*&#39;
indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">-<b>e</b> <i> escape_char</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default:
&#145;<tt>~</tt>&#146;).
The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line.
The escape character followed by a dot
(&#145;<tt>&#46;</tt>&#146;)
closes the connection;
followed by control-Z suspends the connection;
and followed by itself sends the escape character once.
Setting the character to
"none"
disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">-<b>F</b> <i> configfile</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.
If a configuration file is given on the command line,
the system-wide configuration file

The default for the per-user configuration file is
<tt> ~/.ssh/config</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>-<b>f</b>

A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine.
For example,

will start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11
connection will be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.
The

<h1 class="manpages">AUTHENTICATION</h1>
The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocols 1 and 2.
Protocol 2 is the default, with
<b>ssh</b>
falling back to protocol 1 if it detects protocol 2 is unsupported.
These settings may be altered using the
<b> Protocol</b>
option in
<b>ssh_config</b>(5),
or enforced using the
-<b>1</b> 
and
-<b>2</b> 
options (see above).
Both protocols support similar authentication methods,
but protocol 2 is preferred since
it provides additional mechanisms for confidentiality
(the traffic is encrypted using AES, 3DES, Blowfish, CAST128, or Arcfour)
and integrity (hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-ripemd160).
Protocol 1 lacks a strong mechanism for ensuring the
integrity of the connection.
<p>
The methods available for authentication are:
host-based authentication,
public key authentication,
challenge-response authentication,
and password authentication.
Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above,
though protocol 2 has a configuration option to change the default order:
<b> PreferredAuthentications</b>.
<p>
Host-based authentication works as follows:
If the machine the user logs in from is listed in
<tt> /etc/hosts.equiv</tt>
or
<tt> /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</tt>
on the remote machine, and the user names are
the same on both sides, or if the files
<tt> ~/.rhosts</tt>
or
<tt> ~/.shosts</tt>
exist in the user&#146;s home directory on the
remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the client
machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user is
considered for login.
Additionally, the server
<i> must</i>
be able to verify the client&#146;s
host key (see the description of
<tt> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</tt>
and
<tt> ~/.ssh/known_hosts</tt>,
below)
for login to be permitted.
This authentication method closes security holes due to IP
spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing.
[Note to the administrator:
<tt> /etc/hosts.equiv</tt>,
<tt> ~/.rhosts</tt>,
and the rlogin/rsh protocol in general, are inherently insecure and should be
disabled if security is desired.]
<p>
Public key authentication works as follows:
The scheme is based on public-key cryptography,
using cryptosystems
where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys,
and it is unfeasible to derive the decryption key from the encryption key.
The idea is that each user creates a public/private
key pair for authentication purposes.
The server knows the public key, and only the user knows the private key.
<b>ssh</b>
implements public key authentication protocol automatically,
using either the RSA or DSA algorithms.
Protocol 1 is restricted to using only RSA keys,
but protocol 2 may use either.
The
HISTORY
section of
<b>ssl</b>(8)
contains a brief discussion of the two algorithms.
<p>
The file
<tt> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>
lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in.
When the user logs in, the
<b>ssh</b>
program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for
authentication.
The client proves that it has access to the private key
and the server checks that the corresponding public key
is authorized to accept the account.
<p>
The user creates his/her key pair by running
<b>ssh-keygen</b>(1).
This stores the private key in
<tt> ~/.ssh/identity</tt>
(protocol 1),
<tt> ~/.ssh/id_dsa</tt>
(protocol 2 DSA),
or
<tt> ~/.ssh/id_rsa</tt>
(protocol 2 RSA)
and stores the public key in
<tt> ~/.ssh/identity.pub</tt>
(protocol 1),
<tt> ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</tt>
(protocol 2 DSA),
or
<tt> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</tt>
(protocol 2 RSA)
in the user&#146;s home directory.
The user should then copy the public key
to
<tt> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>
in his/her home directory on the remote machine.
The
<tt> authorized_keys</tt>
file corresponds to the conventional
<tt> ~/.rhosts</tt>
file, and has one key
per line, though the lines can be very long.
After this, the user can log in without giving the password.
<p>
The most convenient way to use public key authentication may be with an
authentication agent.
See
<b>ssh-agent</b>(1)
for more information.
<p>
Challenge-response authentication works as follows:
The server sends an arbitrary
"challenge"
text, and prompts for a response.
Protocol 2 allows multiple challenges and responses;
protocol 1 is restricted to just one challenge/response.
Examples of challenge-response authentication include
BSD Authentication (see
<b>login.conf</b>(5))
and PAM (some non-OpenBSD systems).
<p>
Finally, if other authentication methods fail,
<b>ssh</b>
prompts the user for a password.
The password is sent to the remote
host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted,
the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network.
<p>
<b>ssh</b>
automatically maintains and checks a database containing
identification for all hosts it has ever been used with.
Host keys are stored in
<tt> ~/.ssh/known_hosts</tt>
in the user&#146;s home directory.
Additionally, the file
<tt> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</tt>
is automatically checked for known hosts.
Any new hosts are automatically added to the user&#146;s file.
If a host&#146;s identification ever changes,
<b>ssh</b>
warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent
server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks,
which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.
The
<b> StrictHostKeyChecking</b>
option can be used to control logins to machines whose
host key is not known or has changed.
<p>
When the user&#146;s identity has been accepted by the server, the server
either executes the given command, or logs into the machine and gives
the user a normal shell on the remote machine.
All communication with
the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.
<p>
If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated (normal login session), the
user may use the escape characters noted below.
<p>
If no pseudo-tty has been allocated,
the session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data.
On most systems, setting the escape character to
"none"
will also make the session transparent even if a tty is used.
<p>
The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote
machine exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed.
<h1 class="manpages">ESCAPE CHARACTERS</h1>
When a pseudo-terminal has been requested,
<b>ssh</b>
supports a number of functions through the use of an escape character.
<p>
A single tilde character can be sent as
<b> ~~</b>
or by following the tilde by a character other than those described below.
The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as
special.
The escape character can be changed in configuration files using the
<b> EscapeChar</b>
configuration directive or on the command line by the
-<b>e</b> 
option.
<p>
The supported escapes (assuming the default
&#145;<tt>~</tt>&#146;)
are:

</table>
<h1 class="manpages">TCP FORWARDING</h1>
Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over the secure channel can
be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file.
One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a
mail server; another is going through firewalls.
<p>
In the example below, we look at encrypting communication between
an IRC client and server, even though the IRC server does not directly
support encrypted communications.
This works as follows:
the user connects to the remote host using
<b>ssh</b>,
specifying a port to be used to forward connections
to the remote server.
After that it is possible to start the service which is to be encrypted
on the client machine,
connecting to the same local port,
and
<b>ssh</b>
will encrypt and forward the connection.
<p>
The following example tunnels an IRC session from client machine
"127.0.0.1"
(localhost)
to remote server
"server.example.com":
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
$ ssh -f -L 1234:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10
$ irc -c &#146;#users&#146; -p 1234 pinky 127.0.0.1
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This tunnels a connection to IRC server
"server.example.com",
joining channel
"#users",
nickname
"pinky",
using port 1234.
It doesn&#146;t matter which port is used,
as long as it&#146;s greater than 1023
(remember, only root can open sockets on privileged ports)
and doesn&#146;t conflict with any ports already in use.
The connection is forwarded to port 6667 on the remote server,
since that&#146;s the standard port for IRC services.
<p>
The
-<b>f</b> 
option backgrounds
<b>ssh</b>
and the remote command
"sleep 10"
is specified to allow an amount of time
(10 seconds, in the example)
to start the service which is to be tunnelled.
If no connections are made within the time specified,
<b>ssh</b>
will exit.
<h1 class="manpages">X11 FORWARDING</h1>
If the
<b> ForwardX11</b>
variable is set to
"yes"
(or see the description of the
-<b>X</b> ,
-<b>x</b> ,
and
-<b>Y</b> 
options above)
and the user is using X11 (the
<i> DISPLAY</i>
environment variable is set), the connection to the X11 display is
automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11
programs started from the shell (or command) will go through the
encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made
from the local machine.
The user should not manually set
<i> DISPLAY</i>.
Forwarding of X11 connections can be
configured on the command line or in configuration files.
<p>
The
<i> DISPLAY</i>
value set by
<b>ssh</b>
will point to the server machine, but with a display number greater than zero.
This is normal, and happens because
<b>ssh</b>
creates a
"proxy"
X server on the server machine for forwarding the
connections over the encrypted channel.
<p>
<b>ssh</b>
will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.
For this purpose, it will generate a random authorization cookie,
store it in Xauthority on the server, and verify that any forwarded
connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when
the connection is opened.
The real authentication cookie is never
sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the plain).
<p>
If the
<b> ForwardAgent</b>
variable is set to
"yes"
(or see the description of the
-<b>A</b> 
and
-<b>a</b> 
options above) and
the user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent
is automatically forwarded to the remote side.
<h1 class="manpages">VERIFYING HOST KEYS</h1>
When connecting to a server for the first time,
a fingerprint of the server&#146;s public key is presented to the user
(unless the option
<b> StrictHostKeyChecking</b>
has been disabled).
Fingerprints can be determined using
<b>ssh-keygen</b>(1):
<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> $ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</tt><p>

<p>
If the fingerprint is already known,
it can be matched and verified,
and the key can be accepted.
If the fingerprint is unknown,
an alternative method of verification is available:
SSH fingerprints verified by DNS.
An additional resource record (RR),
SSHFP,
is added to a zonefile
and the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint
with that of the key presented.
<p>
In this example, we are connecting a client to a server,
"host.example.com".
The SSHFP resource records should first be added to the zonefile for
host.example.com:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
$ ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub -r host.example.com.
$ ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub -r host.example.com.
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.
To check that the zone is answering fingerprint queries:
<p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com</tt><p>

<p>
Finally the client connects:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
$ ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" host.example.com
[...]
Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
See the
<b> VerifyHostKeyDNS</b>
option in
<b>ssh_config</b>(5)
for more information.
<h1 class="manpages">SSH-BASED VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS</h1>
<b>ssh</b>
contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling
using the
<b>tun</b>(4)
network pseudo-device,
allowing two networks to be joined securely.
The
<b>sshd_config</b>(5)
configuration option
<b> PermitTunnel</b>
controls whether the server supports this,
and at what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).
<p>
The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24
with remote network 10.0.99.0/24, provided that the SSH server
running on the gateway to the remote network,
at 192.168.1.15, allows it:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
# ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true
# ifconfig tun0 10.0.50.1 10.0.99.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Client access may be more finely tuned via the
<tt> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>
file (see below) and the
<b> PermitRootLogin</b>
server option.
The following entry would permit connections on the first
<b>tun</b>(4)
device from user
"jane"
and on the second device from user
"john",
if
<b> PermitRootLogin</b>
is set to
"forced-commands-only":
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
tunnel="1",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... jane
tunnel="2",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... john
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Since a SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead,
it may be more suited to temporary setups,
such as for wireless VPNs.
More permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as
<b>ipsecctl</b>(8)
and
<b>isakmpd</b>(8).
<h1 class="manpages">ENVIRONMENT</h1>

These three files contain the private parts of the host keys
and are used for host-based authentication.
If protocol version 1 is used,
<b>ssh</b>
must be setuid root, since the host key is readable only by root.
For protocol version 2,
<b>ssh</b>
uses
<b>ssh-keysign</b>(8)
to access the host keys,
eliminating the requirement that
<b>ssh</b>
be setuid root when host-based authentication is used.
By default
<b>ssh</b>
is not setuid root.

OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free
ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen.
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
Theo de Raadt and Dug Song
removed many bugs, re-added newer features and
created OpenSSH.
Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.
