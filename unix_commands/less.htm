<p>
<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<i>Less</i> is a program similar to
<i>more</i> (1), but which allows backward movement
in the file as well as forward movement.
Also,
<i>less</i> does not have to read the entire input file before starting,
so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
<i>vi</i> (1).
<i>Less</i> uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems),
so it can run on a variety of terminals.
There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
(On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top
of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)
<p>
Commands are based on both
<i>more</i> and
<i>vi.</i> Commands may be preceded by a decimal number,
called N in the descriptions below.
The number is used by some commands, as indicated.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">COMMANDS</h1>
In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
ESC stands for the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the
two character sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

If you forget all the other commands, remember this one.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
SPACE or ^V or f or ^F

ESC-) or RIGHTARROW
</td><td>
Scroll horizontally right N characters, default half the screen width
(see the -# option).
If a number N is specified, it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW
and LEFTARROW commands.
While the text is scrolled, it acts as though the -S option
(chop lines) were in effect.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-( or LEFTARROW
</td><td>
Scroll horizontally left N characters, default half the screen width
(see the -# option).
If a number N is specified, it becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW

Useful if the file is changing while it is being viewed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
F
</td><td>
Scroll forward, and keep trying to read when the
end of file is reached.
Normally this command would be used when already at the end of the file.
It is a way to monitor the tail of a file which is growing
while it is being viewed.
(The behavior is similar to the "tail -f" command.)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
g or &lt; or ESC-&lt;

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-^B
</td><td>
Followed by two characters,

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
m
</td><td>
Followed by any lowercase letter,
marks the current position with that letter.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
&#146;
</td><td>
(Single quote.)
Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to the position which
was previously marked with that letter.
Followed by another single quote, returns to the position at
which the last "large" movement command was executed.
Followed by a ^ or $, jumps to the beginning or end of the
file respectively.
Marks are preserved when a new file is examined,
so the &#146; command can be used to switch between input files.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^X^X
</td><td>
Same as single quote.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
/pattern
</td><td>
Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
N defaults to 1.
The pattern is a regular expression, as recognized by
the regular expression library supplied by your system.
The search starts at the second line displayed
(but see the -a and -j options, which change this).
<p>
Certain characters are special
if entered at the beginning of the pattern;
they modify the type of search rather than become part of the pattern:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^N or !
</td><td>
Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^E or *
</td><td>
Search multiple files.
That is, if the search reaches the END of the current file
without finding a match,
the search continues in the next file in the command line list.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^F or @
</td><td>
Begin the search at the first line of the FIRST file
in the command line list,
regardless of what is currently displayed on the screen
or the settings of the -a or -j options.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^K
</td><td>
Highlight any text which matches the pattern on the current screen,
but don&#146;t move to the first match (KEEP current position).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^R
</td><td>
Don&#146;t interpret regular expression metacharacters;
that is, do a simple textual comparison.
</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
?pattern
</td><td>
Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
The search starts at the line immediately before the top line displayed.
<p>
Certain characters are special as in the / command:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^N or !
</td><td>
Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.

the search continues in the previous file in the command line list.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^F or @

Begin the search at the last line of the last file
in the command line list,
regardless of what is currently displayed on the screen
or the settings of the -a or -j options.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^K

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-?pattern
</td><td>
Same as "?*".
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
n
</td><td>
Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pattern.
If the previous search was modified by ^N, the search is made for the
N-th line NOT containing the pattern.
If the previous search was modified by ^E, the search continues
in the next (or previous) file if not satisfied in the current file.
If the previous search was modified by ^R, the search is done
without using regular expressions.
There is no effect if the previous search was modified by ^F or ^K.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
N
</td><td>
Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-n
</td><td>
Repeat previous search, but crossing file boundaries.
The effect is as if the previous search were modified by *.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-N
</td><td>
Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction
and crossing file boundaries.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
ESC-u
</td><td>
Undo search highlighting.
Turn off highlighting of strings matching the current search pattern.
If highlighting is already off because of a previous ESC-u command,
turn highlighting back on.
Any search command will also turn highlighting back on.
(Highlighting can also be disabled by toggling the -G option;
in that case search commands do not turn highlighting back on.)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
&pattern
</td><td>
Display only lines which match the pattern;
lines which do not match the pattern are not displayed.
If pattern is empty (if you type & immediately followed by ENTER),
any filtering is turned off, and all lines are displayed.
While filtering is in effect, an ampersand is displayed at the
beginning of the prompt,
as a reminder that some lines in the file may be hidden.
<p>
Certain characters are special as in the / command:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^N or !

</td><td>
Don&#146;t interpret regular expression metacharacters;
that is, do a simple textual comparison.
</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
:e [filename]
</td><td>
Examine a new file.
If the filename is missing, the "current" file (see the :n and :p commands
below) from the list of files in the command line is re-examined.
A percent sign (%) in the filename is replaced by the name of the
current file. 
A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously examined file.
However, two consecutive percent signs are simply
replaced with a single percent sign. 
This allows you to enter a filename that contains a percent sign
in the name.
Similarly, two consecutive pound signs are replaced with a single pound sign.
The filename is inserted into the command line list of files
so that it can be seen by subsequent :n and :p commands.
If the filename consists of several files, they are all inserted into
the list of files and the first one is examined.
If the filename contains one or more spaces,
the entire filename should be enclosed in double quotes
(also see the -" option).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
^X^V or E
</td><td>
Same as :e.
Warning: some systems use ^V as a special literalization character.
On such systems, you may not be able to use ^V.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
:n
</td><td>
Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command line).
If a number N is specified, the N-th next file is examined.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
:p
</td><td>

</table>
<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS</h1>
Command line options are described below.
Most options may be changed while
<i>less</i> is running, via the "-" command.
<p>
Most options may be given in one of two forms:
either a dash followed by a single letter,
or two dashes followed by a long option name.
A long option name may be abbreviated as long as
the abbreviation is unambiguous.
For example, --quit-at-eof may be abbreviated --quit, but not
--qui, since both --quit-at-eof and --quiet begin with --qui.
Some long option names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as
distinct from --quit-at-eof.
Such option names need only have their first letter capitalized;
the remainder of the name may be in either case.
For example, --Quit-at-eof is equivalent to --QUIT-AT-EOF.
<p>
Options are also taken from the environment variable "LESS".
For example,
to avoid typing "less -options ..." each time
<i>less</i> is invoked, you might tell
<i>csh:</i> <p>
setenv LESS "-options"
<p>
or if you use
<i>sh:</i> <p>
LESS="-options"; export LESS
<p>
On MS-DOS, you don&#146;t need the quotes, but you should replace any
percent signs in the options string by double percent signs.
<p>
The environment variable is parsed before the command line,
so command line options override the LESS environment variable.
If an option appears in the LESS variable, it can be reset
to its default value on the command line by beginning the command
line option with "-+".
<p>
For options like -P or -D which take a following string,
a dollar sign ($) must be used to signal the end of the string.
For example, to set two -D options on MS-DOS, you must have
a dollar sign between them, like this:
<p>
LESS="-Dn9.1$-Ds4.1"
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-? or --help
</td><td>
This option displays a summary of the commands accepted by
<i>less</i> (the same as the h command).
(Depending on how your shell interprets the question mark,
it may be necessary to quote the question mark, thus: "-&#92;?".)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-a or --search-skip-screen
</td><td>
Causes searches to start after the last line
displayed on the screen,
thus skipping all lines displayed on the screen.
By default, searches start at the second line on the screen
(or after the last found line; see the -j option).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-b<i>n</i> or --buffers=<i>n</i>
</td><td>
Specifies the amount of buffer space
<i>less</i> will use for each file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes).
By default 64K of buffer space is used for each file
(unless the file is a pipe; see the -B option).
The -b option specifies instead that <i>n</i> kilobytes of
buffer space should be used for each file.
If <i>n</i> is -1, buffer space is unlimited; that is,
the entire file can be read into memory.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-B or --auto-buffers
</td><td>
By default, when data is read from a pipe,
buffers are allocated automatically as needed.
If a large amount of data is read from the pipe, this can cause
a large amount of memory to be allocated.
The -B option disables this automatic allocation of buffers for pipes,
so that only 64K
(or the amount of space specified by the -b option)
is used for the pipe.
Warning: use of -B can result in erroneous display, since only the
most recently viewed part of the piped data is kept in memory;
any earlier data is lost.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-c or --clear-screen
</td><td>
Causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top line down.
By default,
full screen repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom of the screen.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-C or --CLEAR-SCREEN
</td><td>
Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of
<i>less.</i> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-d or --dumb
</td><td>
The -d option suppresses the error message
normally displayed if the terminal is dumb;
that is, lacks some important capability,
such as the ability to clear the screen or scroll backward.
The -d option does not otherwise change the behavior of
<i>less</i> on a dumb terminal.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-D<b>x</b><i>color</i> or --color=<b>x</b><i>color</i>
</td><td>
[MS-DOS only]
Sets the color of the text displayed.
<b>x</b> is a single character which selects the type of text whose color is
being set: n=normal, s=standout, d=bold, u=underlined, k=blink.
<i>color</i> is a pair of numbers separated by a period. 
The first number selects the foreground color and the second selects
the background color of the text.
A single number <i>N</i> is the same as <i>N.M</i>,
where <i>M</i> is the normal background color.
<p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-e or --quit-at-eof
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to automatically exit
the second time it reaches end-of-file.
By default, the only way to exit
<i>less</i> is via the "q" command.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-E or --QUIT-AT-EOF
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to automatically exit the first time it reaches end-of-file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-f or --force
</td><td>
Forces non-regular files to be opened.
(A non-regular file is a directory or a device special file.)
Also suppresses the warning message when a binary file is opened.
By default,
<i>less</i> will refuse to open non-regular files.
Note that some operating systems will not allow directories
to be read, even if -f is set.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-F or --quit-if-one-screen
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to automatically exit
if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-g or --hilite-search
</td><td>
Normally,
<i>less</i> will highlight ALL strings which match the last search command.
The -g option changes this behavior to highlight only the particular string
which was found by the last search command.
This can cause
<i>less</i> to run somewhat faster than the default.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-G or --HILITE-SEARCH
</td><td>
The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found by search commands.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
--old-bot
</td><td>
Reverts to the old bottom of screen behavior.  This can be sometimes 
desirable  if  the  long lines are not wrapped  correctly
when  reaching  the  bottom  of  the  terminal,  while scrolling forward.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-h<i>n</i> or --max-back-scroll=<i>n</i>
</td><td>
Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll backward.
If it is necessary to scroll backward more than <i>n</i> lines,
the screen is repainted in a forward direction instead.
(If the terminal does not have the ability to scroll
backward, -h0 is implied.)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-i or --ignore-case
</td><td>
Causes searches to ignore case; that is,
uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.
This option is ignored if any uppercase letters
appear in the search pattern;
in other words,
if a pattern contains uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-I or --IGNORE-CASE
</td><td>
Like -i, but searches ignore case even if
the pattern contains uppercase letters.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-j<i>n</i> or --jump-target=<i>n</i>
</td><td>
Specifies a line on the screen where the "target" line
is to be positioned.
The target line is the line specified by any command to
search for a pattern, jump to a line number,
jump to a file percentage or jump to a tag.
The screen line may be specified by a number: the top line on the screen
is 1, the next is 2, and so on.
The number may be negative to specify a line relative to the bottom
of the screen: the bottom line on the screen is -1, the second
to the bottom is -2, and so on.
Alternately, the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height
of the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the
screen, .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on.
If the line is specified as a fraction, the actual line number
is recalculated if the terminal window is resized, so that the
target line remains at the specified fraction of the screen height.
If any form of the -j option is used,
forward searches begin at the line immediately after the target line,
and backward searches begin at the target line.
For example, if "-j4" is used, the target line is the
fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line
on the screen.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-J or --status-column
</td><td>
Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen.
The status column shows the lines that matched the current search.
The status column is also used if the -w or -W option is in effect.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-k<i>filename</i> or --lesskey-file=<i>filename</i>
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to open and interpret the named file as a
<i>lesskey</i> (1) file.
Multiple -k options may be specified.
If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or
if a lesskey file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS),
it is also used as a
<i>lesskey</i> file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-K or --quit-on-intr
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to exit immediately when an interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed.
Normally, an interrupt character causes
<i>less</i> to stop whatever it is doing and return to its command prompt.
Note that use of this option makes it impossible to return to the
command prompt from the "F" command.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-L or --no-lessopen
</td><td>
Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable
(see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR section below).
This option can be set from within <i>less</i>,
but it will apply only to files opened subsequently, not to the
file which is currently open.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-m or --long-prompt
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to prompt verbosely (like <i>more</i>),
with the percent into the file.
By default,
<i>less</i> prompts with a colon.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-M or --LONG-PROMPT
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to prompt even more verbosely than
<i>more.</i> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-n or --line-numbers
</td><td>
Suppresses line numbers.
The default (to use line numbers) may cause
<i>less</i> to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large input file.
Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem.
Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the verbose
prompt and in the = command,
and the v command will pass the current line number to the editor
(see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-N or --LINE-NUMBERS
</td><td>
Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of
each line in the display.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-o<i>filename</i> or --log-file=<i>filename</i>
</td><td>
Causes
<i>less</i> to copy its input to the named file as it is being viewed.
This applies only when the input file is a pipe,
not an ordinary file.
If the file already exists,
<i>less</i> will ask for confirmation before overwriting it.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-O<i>filename</i> or --LOG-FILE=<i>filename</i>
</td><td>
The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing
file without asking for confirmation.
<p>
If no log file has been specified,
the -o and -O options can be used from within
<i>less</i> to specify a log file.
Without a file name, they will simply report the name of the log file.
The "s" command is equivalent to specifying -o from within
<i>less.</i> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-p<i>pattern</i> or --pattern=<i>pattern</i>
</td><td>
The -p option on the command line is equivalent to
specifying +/<i>pattern</i>;
that is, it tells
<i>less</i> to start at the first occurrence of <i>pattern</i> in the file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-P<i>prompt</i> or --prompt=<i>prompt</i>
</td><td>
Provides a way to tailor the three prompt
styles to your own preference.
This option would normally be put in the LESS environment
variable, rather than being typed in with each
<i>less</i> command.
Such an option must either be the last option in the LESS variable,
or be terminated by a dollar sign.
-Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt
to that string.
-Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt.
-PM changes the long (-M) prompt.
-Ph changes the prompt for the help screen.
-P= changes the message printed by the = command.
-Pw changes the message printed while waiting for data (in the F command).
All prompt strings consist of a sequence of
letters and special escape sequences.
See the section on PROMPTS for more details.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-q or --quiet or --silent
</td><td>
Causes moderately "quiet" operation:
the terminal bell is not rung
if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file
or before the beginning of the file.
If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used instead.
The bell will be rung on certain other errors,
such as typing an invalid character.
The default is to ring the terminal bell in all such cases.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-Q or --QUIET or --SILENT
</td><td>
Causes totally "quiet" operation:
the terminal bell is never rung.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-r or --raw-control-chars
</td><td>
Causes "raw" control characters to be displayed.
The default is to display control characters using the caret notation;
for example, a control-A (octal 001) is displayed as "^A".
Warning: when the -r option is used,
<i>less</i> cannot keep track of the actual appearance of the screen
(since this depends on how the screen responds to
each type of control character).
Thus, various display problems may result,
such as long lines being split in the wrong place.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
</td><td>
Like -r, but only ANSI "color" escape sequences are output in "raw" form.
Unlike -r, the screen appearance is maintained correctly in most cases.
ANSI "color" escape sequences are sequences of the form:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESC [ ... m
<p>
where the "..." is zero or more color specification characters
For the purpose of keeping track of screen appearance,
ANSI color escape sequences are assumed to not move the cursor.
You can make
<i>less</i> think that characters other than "m" can end ANSI color escape sequences
by setting the environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the list of
characters which can end a color escape sequence.
And you can make
<i>less</i> think that characters other than the standard ones may appear between
the ESC and the m by setting the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS
to the list of characters which can appear.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-s or --squeeze-blank-lines
</td><td>
Causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single blank line.
This is useful when viewing
<i>nroff</i> output.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-S or --chop-long-lines
</td><td>
Causes lines longer than the screen width to be
chopped rather than folded.
That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in
the screen width is not shown.
The default is to fold long lines; that is, display the remainder
on the next line.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-t<i>tag</i> or --tag=<i>tag</i>
</td><td>
The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG,
will edit the file containing that tag.
For this to work, tag information must be available;
for example, there may be a file in the current directory called "tags",
which was previously built by
<i>ctags</i> (1) or an equivalent command.
If the environment variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is taken to be
the name of a command compatible with
<i>global</i> (1), and that command is executed to find the tag.
(See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html</a>).
The -t option may also be specified from within
<i>less</i> (using the - command) as a way of examining a new file.
The command ":t" is equivalent to specifying -t from within
<i>less.</i> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-T<i>tagsfile</i> or --tag-file=<i>tagsfile</i>
</td><td>
Specifies a tags file to be used instead of "tags".
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-u or --underline-special
</td><td>
Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated as printable characters;
that is, they are sent to the terminal when they appear in the input.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-U or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL
</td><td>
Causes backspaces, tabs and carriage returns to be
treated as control characters;
that is, they are handled as specified by the -r option.
<p>
By default, if neither -u nor -U is given,
backspaces which appear adjacent to an underscore character
are treated specially:
the underlined text is displayed
using the terminal&#146;s hardware underlining capability.
Also, backspaces which appear between two identical characters
are treated specially:
the overstruck text is printed
using the terminal&#146;s hardware boldface capability.
Other backspaces are deleted, along with the preceding character.
Carriage returns immediately followed by a newline are deleted.
other carriage returns are handled as specified by the -r option.
Text which is overstruck or underlined can be searched for
if neither -u nor -U is in effect.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-V or --version
</td><td>
Displays the version number of
<i>less.</i> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-w or --hilite-unread
</td><td>
Temporarily highlights the first "new" line after a forward movement
of a full page.
The first "new" line is the line immediately following the line previously
at the bottom of the screen.
Also highlights the target line after a g or p command.
The highlight is removed at the next command which causes movement.
The entire line is highlighted, unless the -J option is in effect,
in which case only the status column is highlighted.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-W or --HILITE-UNREAD
</td><td>
Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line after any
forward movement command larger than one line.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-x<i>n</i>,... or --tabs=<i>n</i>,...
</td><td>
Sets tab stops.
If only one <i>n</i> is specified, tab stops are set at multiples of <i>n</i>.
If multiple values separated by commas are specified, tab stops
are set at those positions, and then continue with the same spacing as the
last two.
For example, <i>-x9,17</i> will set tabs at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc.
The default for <i>n</i> is 8.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-X or --no-init
</td><td>
Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
to the terminal.
This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string does
something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-y<i>n</i> or --max-forw-scroll=<i>n</i>
</td><td>
Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll forward.
If it is necessary to scroll forward more than <i>n</i> lines,
the screen is repainted instead.
The -c or -C option may be used to repaint from the top of
the screen if desired.
By default, any forward movement causes scrolling.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-[z]<i>n</i> or --window=<i>n</i>
</td><td>
Changes the default scrolling window size to <i>n</i> lines.
The default is one screenful.
The z and w commands can also be used to change the window size.
The "z" may be omitted for compatibility with some versions of
<i>more.</i> If the number
<i>n</i> is negative, it indicates
<i>n</i> lines less than the current screen size.
For example, if the screen is 24 lines, <i>-z-4</i> sets the
scrolling window to 20 lines.  If the screen is resized to 40 lines,
the scrolling window automatically changes to 36 lines.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-<i><blink><blink>\(</blink>dq</blink>cc</i> or --quotes=<i>cc</i>
</td><td>
Changes the filename quoting character.
This may be necessary if you are trying to name a file
which contains both spaces and quote characters.
Followed by a single character, this changes the quote character to that
character.
Filenames containing a space should then be surrounded by that character
rather than by double quotes.
Followed by two characters, changes the open quote to the first character,
and the close quote to the second character.
Filenames containing a space should then be preceded by the open quote
character and followed by the close quote character.
Note that even after the quote characters are changed, this option
remains -" (a dash followed by a double quote).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-~ or --tilde
</td><td>
Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a single tilde (~).
This option causes lines after end of file to be displayed as blank lines.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
-# or --shift
</td><td>
Specifies the default number of positions to scroll horizontally
in the RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands.
If the number specified is zero, it sets the default number of
positions to one half of the screen width.
Alternately, the number may be specified as a fraction of the width
of the screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of the
screen width, .3 is three tenths of the screen width, and so on.
If the number is specified as a fraction, the actual number of
scroll positions is recalculated if the terminal window is resized,
so that the actual scroll remains at the specified fraction
of the screen width.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
--no-keypad
</td><td>
Disables sending the keypad initialization and deinitialization strings
to the terminal.
This is sometimes useful if the keypad strings make the numeric
keypad behave in an undesirable manner.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
--follow-name
</td><td>
Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F command is executing,
<i>less</i> will continue to display the contents of the original file despite
its name change.
If --follow-name is specified, during an F command
<i>less</i> will periodically attempt to reopen the file by name.
If the reopen succeeds and the file is a different file from the original
(which means that a new file has been created
with the same name as the original (now renamed) file),
<i>less</i> will display the contents of that new file.

If a command line option begins with <b>+</b>,
the remainder of that option is taken to be an initial command to
<i>less.</i> For example, +G tells
<i>less</i> to start at the end of the file rather than the beginning,
and +/xyz tells it to start at the first occurrence of "xyz" in the file.
As a special case, +&lt;number&gt; acts like +&lt;number&gt;g;
that is, it starts the display at the specified line number
(however, see the caveat under the "g" command above).
If the option starts with ++, the initial command applies to
every file being viewed, not just the first one.
The + command described previously
may also be used to set (or change) an initial command for every file.

<h1 class="manpages">LINE EDITING</h1>
When entering command line at the bottom of the screen
(for example, a filename for the :e command,
or the pattern for a search command),
certain keys can be used to manipulate the command line.
Most commands have an alternate form in [ brackets ] which can be used if
a key does not exist on a particular keyboard.
(Note that the forms beginning with ESC do not work
in some MS-DOS and Windows systems because ESC is the line erase character.)
Any of these special keys may be entered literally by preceding
it with the "literal" character, either ^V or ^A.
A backslash itself may also be entered literally by entering two backslashes.

<h1 class="manpages">KEY BINDINGS</h1>
You may define your own
<i>less</i> commands by using the program
<i>lesskey</i> (1)
to create a lesskey file.
This file specifies a set of command keys and an action
associated with each key.
You may also use
<i>lesskey</i> to change the line-editing keys (see LINE EDITING),
and to set environment variables.
If the environment variable LESSKEY is set,
<i>less</i> uses that as the name of the lesskey file.
Otherwise,
<i>less</i> looks in a standard place for the lesskey file:
On Unix systems,
<i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file called "$HOME/.less".
On MS-DOS and Windows systems,
<i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file called "$HOME/_less", and if it is not found there,
then looks for a lesskey file called "_less" in any directory specified
in the PATH environment variable.
On OS/2 systems,
<i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file called "$HOME/less.ini", and if it is not found,
then looks for a lesskey file called "less.ini" in any directory specified
in the INIT environment variable, and if it not found there,
then looks for a lesskey file called "less.ini" in any directory specified
in the PATH environment variable.
See the
<i>lesskey</i> manual page for more details.
<p>
A system-wide lesskey file may also be set up to provide key bindings.
If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file and in the
system-wide file, key bindings in the local file take precedence over
those in the system-wide file.
If the environment variable LESSKEY_SYSTEM is set,
<i>less</i> uses that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file.
Otherwise,
<i>less</i> looks in a standard place for the system-wide lesskey file:
On Unix systems, the system-wide lesskey file is /usr/local/etc/sysless.
(However, if
<i>less</i> was built with a different sysconf directory than /usr/local/etc,
that directory is where the sysless file is found.)
On MS-DOS and Windows systems, the system-wide lesskey file is c:&#92;_sysless.
On OS/2 systems, the system-wide lesskey file is c:&#92;sysless.ini.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">INPUT PREPROCESSOR</h1>
You may define an "input preprocessor" for
<i>less.</i> Before
<i>less</i> opens a file, it first gives your input preprocessor a chance to modify the
way the contents of the file are displayed.
An input preprocessor is simply an executable program (or shell script),
which writes the contents of the file to a different file,
called the replacement file.
The contents of the replacement file are then displayed
in place of the contents of the original file.
However, it will appear to the user as if the original file is opened;
that is,
<i>less</i> will display the original filename as the name of the current file.
<p>
An input preprocessor receives one command line argument, the original filename,
as entered by the user.
It should create the replacement file, and when finished,
print the name of the replacement file to its standard output.
If the input preprocessor does not output a replacement filename,
<i>less</i> uses the original file, as normal.
The input preprocessor is not called when viewing standard input.
To set up an input preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment variable
to a command line which will invoke your input preprocessor.
This command line should include one occurrence of the string "%s",
which will be replaced by the filename
when the input preprocessor command is invoked.
<p>
When
<i>less</i> closes a file opened in such a way, it will call another program,
called the input postprocessor,
which may perform any desired clean-up action (such as deleting the
replacement file created by LESSOPEN).
This program receives two command line arguments, the original filename
as entered by the user, and the name of the replacement file.
To set up an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE environment variable
to a command line which will invoke your input postprocessor.
It may include two occurrences of the string "%s";
the first is replaced with the original name of the file and
the second with the name of the replacement file,
which was output by LESSOPEN.
<p>
For example, on many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow you
to keep files in compressed format, but still let
<i>less</i> view them directly:
<p>
lessopen.sh:
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/sh
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case "$1" in
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*.Z)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncompress - $1  &gt;/tmp/less.$$  2&gt;/dev/null
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if [ -s /tmp/less.$$ ]; then
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo /tmp/less.$$
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rm -f /tmp/less.$$
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;;
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;esac
<p>
lessclose.sh:
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/sh
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rm $2
<p>
To use these scripts, put them both where they can be executed and
set LESSOPEN="lessopen.sh %s", and
LESSCLOSE="lessclose.sh %s %s".
More complex LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE scripts may be written
to accept other types of compressed files, and so on.
<p>
It is also possible to set up an input preprocessor to
pipe the file data directly to
<i>less,</i> rather than putting the data into a replacement file.
This avoids the need to decompress the entire file before
starting to view it.
An input preprocessor that works this way is called an input pipe.
An input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement file on
its standard output,
writes the entire contents of the replacement file on its standard output.
If the input pipe does not write any characters on its standard output,
then there is no replacement file and
<i>less</i> uses the original file, as normal.
To use an input pipe,
make the first character in the LESSOPEN environment variable a
vertical bar (|) to signify that the input preprocessor is an input pipe.
<p>
For example, on many Unix systems, this script will work like the
previous example scripts:
<p>
lesspipe.sh:
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/sh
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case "$1" in
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*.Z)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncompress -c $1  2&gt;/dev/null
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;;
<!-- Need break --><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;esac
<p>
To use this script, put it where it can be executed and set
LESSOPEN="|lesspipe.sh %s".
When an input pipe is used, a LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used,
but it is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file
to clean up.
In this case, the replacement file name passed to the LESSCLOSE
postprocessor is "-".
<p>
For compatibility with previous versions of
<i>less,</i> the input preprocessor or pipe is not used if
<i>less</i> is viewing standard input. 
However, if the first character of LESSOPEN is a dash (-),
the input preprocessor is used on standard input as well as other files.
In this case, the dash is not considered to be part of
the preprocessor command.
If standard input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed
a file name consisting of a single dash.
Similarly, if the first two characters of LESSOPEN are vertical bar and dash
(|-), the input pipe is used on standard input as well as other files.
Again, in this case the dash is not considered to be part of
the input pipe command.

<!-- PP ends table -->
</table>
In rare cases, it may be desired to tailor
<i>less</i> to use a character set other than the ones definable by LESSCHARSET.
In this case, the environment variable LESSCHARDEF can be used
to define a character set.
It should be set to a string where each character in the string represents
one character in the character set.
The character "." is used for a normal character, "c" for control,
and "b" for binary.
A decimal number may be used for repetition.
For example, "bccc4b." would mean character 0 is binary,
1, 2 and 3 are control, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are binary, and 8 is normal.
All characters after the last are taken to be the same as the last,
so characters 9 through 255 would be normal.
(This is an example, and does not necessarily
represent any real character set.)
<p>
This table shows the value of LESSCHARDEF which is equivalent
to each of the possible values for LESSCHARSET:

<p>
If neither LESSCHARSET nor LESSCHARDEF is set,
but any of the strings "UTF-8", "UTF8", "utf-8" or "utf8"
is found in the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE or LANG
environment variables, then the default character set is utf-8.
<p>
If that string is not found, but your system supports the
<i>setlocale</i> interface,
<i>less</i> will use setlocale to determine the character set.
setlocale is controlled by setting the LANG or LC_CTYPE environment
variables.
<p>
Finally, if the
<i>setlocale</i> interface is also not available, the default character set is latin1.
<p>
Control and binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse video).
Each such character is displayed in caret notation if possible
(e.g. ^A for control-A).  Caret notation is used only if
inverting the 0100 bit results in a normal printable character.
Otherwise, the character is displayed as a hex number in angle brackets.
This format can be changed by
setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable.
LESSBINFMT may begin with a "*" and one character to select
the display attribute:
"*k" is blinking, "*d" is bold, "*u" is underlined, "*s" is standout,
and "*n" is normal.
If LESSBINFMT does not begin with a "*", normal attribute is assumed.
The remainder of LESSBINFMT is a string which may include one
printf-style escape sequence (a % followed by x, X, o, d, etc.).
For example, if LESSBINFMT is "*u[%x]", binary characters
are displayed in underlined hexadecimal surrounded by brackets.
The default if no LESSBINFMT is specified is "*s&lt;%X&gt;".
The default if no LESSBINFMT is specified is "*s&lt;%02X&gt;".
Warning: the result of expanding the character via LESSBINFMT must
be less than 31 characters.
<p>
When the character set is utf-8, the LESSUTFBINFMT environment variable
acts similarly to LESSBINFMT but it applies to Unicode code points
that were successfully decoded but are unsuitable for display (e.g.,
unassigned code points).
Its default value is "&lt;U+%04lX&gt;".
Note that LESSUTFBINFMT and LESSBINFMT share their display attribute
setting ("*x") so specifying one will affect both;
LESSUTFBINFMT is read after LESSBINFMT so its setting, if any,
will have priority.
Problematic octets in a UTF-8 file (octets of a truncated sequence,
octets of a complete but non-shortest form sequence, illegal octets,
and stray trailing octets)
are displayed individually using LESSBINFMT so as to facilitate diagnostic
of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">PROMPTS</h1>
The -P option allows you to tailor the prompt to your preference.
The string given to the -P option replaces the specified prompt string.
Certain characters in the string are interpreted specially.
The prompt mechanism is rather complicated to provide flexibility,
but the ordinary user need not understand the details of constructing
personalized prompt strings.

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
?x
</td><td>
True if there is a next input file
(that is, if the current input file is not the last one).
</td></tr>
<!-- PP ends table -->
</table>
Any characters other than the special ones
(question mark, colon, period, percent, and backslash)
become literally part of the prompt.
Any of the special characters may be included in the prompt literally
by preceding it with a backslash.
<p>
Some examples:
<p>
?f%f:Standard input.
<p>
This prompt prints the filename, if known;
otherwise the string "Standard input".
<p>
?f%f .?ltLine %lt:?pt%pt&#92;%:?btByte %bt:-...
<p>
This prompt would print the filename, if known.
The filename is followed by the line number, if known,
otherwise the percent if known, otherwise the byte offset if known.
Otherwise, a dash is printed.
Notice how each question mark has a matching period,
and how the % after the %pt
is included literally by escaping it with a backslash.
<p>
?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next&#92;: %x..%t
<p>
This prints the filename if this is the first prompt in a file,
followed by the "file N of N" message if there is more
than one input file.
Then, if we are at end-of-file, the string "(END)" is printed
followed by the name of the next file, if there is one.
Finally, any trailing spaces are truncated.
This is the default prompt.
For reference, here are the defaults for
the other two prompts (-m and -M respectively).
Each is broken into two lines here for readability only.
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m) ..?e(END) ?x- Next&#92;: %x.:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?pB%pB&#92;%:byte %bB?s/%s...%t
<p>
?f%f .?n?m(file %i of %m) ..?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte %bB?s/%s. .?e(END) ?x- Next&#92;: %x.:?pB%pB&#92;%..%t
<p>
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
And here is the default message produced by the = command:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
?f%f .?m(file %i of %m) .?ltlines %lt-%lb?L/%L. .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte %bB?s/%s. ?e(END) :?pB%pB&#92;%..%t
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The prompt expansion features are also used for another purpose:
if an environment variable LESSEDIT is defined, it is used
as the command to be executed when the v command is invoked.
The LESSEDIT string is expanded in the same way as the prompt strings.
The default value for LESSEDIT is:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%E ?lm+%lm. %f
<p>
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
Note that this expands to the editor name, followed by a + and the
line number, followed by the file name.
If your editor does not accept the "+linenumber" syntax, or has other
differences in invocation syntax, the LESSEDIT variable can be
changed to modify this default.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">SECURITY</h1>
When the environment variable LESSSECURE is set to 1,
<i>less</i> runs in a "secure" mode.
This means these features are disabled:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Less can also be compiled to be permanently in "secure" mode.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">COMPATIBILITY WITH MORE</h1>
If the environment variable LESS_IS_MORE is set to 1,
or if the program is invoked via a file link named "more",
<i>less</i> behaves (mostly) in conformance with the POSIX "more" command specification.
In this mode, less behaves differently in these ways:
<p>
The -e option works differently.
If the -e option is not set,
<i>less</i> behaves as if the -E option were set.
If the -e option is set,
<i>less</i> behaves as if the -e and -F options were set.
<p>
The -m option works differently.
If the -m option is not set, the medium prompt is used,
and it is prefixed with the string "--More--".
If the -m option is set, the short prompt is used.
<p>
The -n option acts like the -z option.
The normal behavior of the -n option is unavailable in this mode.
<p>
The parameter to the -p option is taken to be a
<i>less</i> command rather than a search pattern.
<p>
The LESS environment variable is ignored,
and the MORE environment variable is used in its place.
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1>
Environment variables may be specified either in the system environment
as usual, or in a
<i>lesskey</i> (1) file.
If environment variables are defined in more than one place,
variables defined in a local lesskey file take precedence over
variables defined in the system environment, which take precedence
over variables defined in the system-wide lesskey file.
