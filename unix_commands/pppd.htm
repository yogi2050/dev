<h1 class="manpages">NAME</h1>
pppd - Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon
<h1 class="manpages">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<b>pppd</b> [
<i>options</i> ]
<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>
PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up
modems, DSL connections, and many other types of point-to-point
links.  The <i>pppd</i> daemon works together with the kernel PPP
driver to establish and maintain a PPP link with another system
(called the <i>peer</i>) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses for each end of the link.  Pppd can also authenticate the
peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer.  PPP can be
used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming
increasingly rare.
<h1 class="manpages">FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS</h1>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<i>ttyname</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Use the serial port called <i>ttyname</i> to communicate with the
peer.  If <i>ttyname</i> does not begin with a slash (/),
the string "/dev/" is prepended to <i>ttyname</i> to form the
name of the device to open.  If no device name is given, or if the
name of the terminal
connected to the standard input is given, pppd will use that terminal,
and will not fork to put itself in the background.  A value for this
option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<i>speed</i> </td><td valign="bottom">
An option that is a decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate
for the serial device.  On systems such as
4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified.  Other systems
(e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud rates.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>asyncmap </b><i>map</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end
of the link.  The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the
ASCII control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit
indicates that the corresponding control character should not be used
in PPP packets sent to this system.  The map is encoded as a
hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where the least significant
bit (00000001) represents character 0 and the most significant bit
(80000000) represents character 31.
Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte
escape sequence.
If multiple <i>asyncmap</i> options are given, the values are ORed
together.  If no <i>asyncmap</i> option is given, the default is zero,
so pppd will ask the peer not to escape any control characters.
To escape transmitted characters, use the <i>escape</i> option.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>auth</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network
packets to be sent or received.  This option is the default if the
system has a default route.  If neither this option nor the
<i>noauth</i> option is specified, pppd will only allow the peer to use
IP addresses to which the system does not already have a route.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>call </b><i>name</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Read additional options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/<i>name</i>.  This
file may contain privileged options, such as <i>noauth</i>, even if pppd
is not being run by root.  The <i>name</i> string may not begin with /
or include .. as a pathname component.  The format of the options file
is described below.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>connect </b><i>script</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare the link
before the PPP protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up
modem, commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate
phone number.  This option specifies an command for pppd to execute
(by passing it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotiation.
The chat (8) program is often useful here, as it provides a way to
send arbitrary strings to a modem and respond to received characters.
A value
for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>crtscts</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use hardware flow
control using the RTS and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface.
If neither the <i>crtscts</i>, the
<i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor the <i>nocdtrcts</i> option
is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is
left unchanged.
Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement
unidirectional flow control. The serial port will
suspend transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS)
but will be unable to request the modem to stop sending to the
computer. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as
a modem control line.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>defaultroute</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as
the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed.
This entry is removed when the PPP connection is broken.  This option
is privileged if the <i>nodefaultroute</i> option has been specified.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>disconnect </b><i>script</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Execute the command specified by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a
shell, after
pppd has terminated the link.  This command could, for example, issue
commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control
signals were not available.  The disconnect script is not run if the
modem has already hung up.  A value for this option from a privileged
source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>escape </b><i>xx,yy,...</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission
(regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its
async control character map).  The characters to be escaped are
specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas.  Note that
almost any character can be specified for the <i>escape</i> option,
unlike the <i>asyncmap</i> option which only allows control characters
to be specified.  The characters which may not be escaped are those
with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>file </b><i>name</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Read options from file <i>name</i> (the format is described below).
The file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>init </b><i>script</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Execute the command specified by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a shell, to
initialize the serial line.  This script would typically use the
chat(8) program to configure the modem to enable auto answer.  A value
for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a
non-privileged user.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>lock</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file for the
serial device to ensure exclusive access to the device.  By default,
pppd will not create a lock file.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>mru </b><i>n</i> </td><td valign="bottom">
Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to <i>n</i>. Pppd
will ask the peer to send packets of no more than <i>n</i> bytes.
The value of <i>n</i> must be between 128 and 16384; the default is 1500.
A value of
296 works well on very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256
bytes of data).
Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>mtu </b><i>n</i> </td><td valign="bottom">
Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to <i>n</i>.  Unless the
peer requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will
request that the kernel networking code send data packets of no more
than <i>n</i> bytes through the PPP network interface.  Note that for
the IPv6 protocol, the MTU must be at least 1280.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>passive</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Enables the "passive" option in the LCP.  With this option, pppd will
attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the
peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from
the peer, instead of exiting, as it would without this option.
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<i>&lt;local_IP_address&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;remote_IP_address&gt;</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses.  Either one may be
omitted.  The IP addresses can be specified with a host name or in
decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78).  The default local
address is the (first) IP address of the system (unless the
<i>noipdefault</i>
option is given).  The remote address will be obtained from the peer
if not specified in any option.  Thus, in simple cases, this option is
not required.  If a local and/or remote IP address is specified with
this option, pppd
will not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP
negotiation, unless the <i>ipcp-accept-local</i> and/or
<i>ipcp-accept-remote</i> options are given, respectively.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>ipv6 </b><i>&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be
omitted. The identifier must be specified in standard ascii notation of
IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the
<i>ipv6cp-use-ipaddr</i>
option is given, the local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above).
On systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived
from the Ethernet MAC address, <i>ipv6cp-use-persistent</i> option can be
used to replace the <i>ipv6 &lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt;</i> option. Otherwise the
identifier is randomized.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>active-filter </b><i>filter-expression</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to determine
which packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore reset
the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialling
mode.  This option is useful in conjunction with the
<b>idle</b> option if there are packets being sent or received
regularly over the link (for example, routing information packets)
which would otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle.
The <i>filter-expression</i> syntax is as described for tcpdump(1),
except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
<b>ether</b> and <b>arp</b>, are not permitted.  Generally the filter
expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace
in the expression from being interpreted by the shell. This option
is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel
was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).
Note that it
is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing
packets using the <b>inbound</b> and <b>outbound</b> qualifiers.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>allow-ip </b><i>address(es)</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without
authenticating themselves.  The parameter is parsed as for each
element of the list of allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see
the AUTHENTICATION section below).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>allow-number </b><i>number</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number.  A trailing
&#145;*&#146; character will match all numbers beginning with the leading part.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>bsdcomp </b><i>nr,nt</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of <i>nr</i> bits, and
agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of
<i>nt</i> bits.  If <i>nt</i> is not specified, it defaults to the value
given for <i>nr</i>.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for
<i>nr</i> and <i>nt</i>; larger values give better compression but
consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries.
Alternatively, a value of 0 for <i>nr</i> or <i>nt</i> disables
compression in the corresponding direction.  Use <i>nobsdcomp</i> or
<i>bsdcomp 0</i> to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>cdtrcts</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control
the flow of data on the serial port.  If neither the <i>crtscts</i>,
the <i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor the <i>nocdtrcts</i>
option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial
port is left unchanged.
Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow
control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control line.
</td></tr>

When exiting, wait for up to <i>n</i> seconds for any child processes
(such as the command specified with the <b>pty</b> command) to exit
before exiting.  At the end of the timeout, pppd will send a SIGTERM
signal to any remaining child processes and exit.  A value of 0 means
no timeout, that is, pppd will wait until all child processes have
exited.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>connect-delay </b><i>n</i> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
Wait for up to <i>n</i> milliseconds after the connect script finishes for
a valid PPP packet from the peer.  At the end of this time, or when a
valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will commence
negotiation by sending its first LCP packet.  The default value is
1000 (1 second).  This wait period only applies if the <b>connect</b>
or <b>pty</b> option is used.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>debug</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
Enables connection debugging facilities.
If this option is given, pppd will log the contents of all
control packets sent or received in a readable form.  The packets are

<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS FILES</h1>
Options can be taken from files as well as the command line.  Pppd
reads options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and
/etc/ppp/options.<i>ttyname</i> (in that order) before processing the
options on the command line.  (In fact, the command-line options are
scanned to find the terminal name before the options.<i>ttyname</i>
file is read.)  In forming the name of the options.<i>ttyname</i> file,
the initial /dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining
/ characters are replaced with dots.
<p>
An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by
whitespace.  Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the
word in double-quotes (").  A backslash (\) quotes the following character.
A hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the
line.  There is no restriction on using the <i>file</i> or <i>call</i>
options within an options file.
<h1 class="manpages">SECURITY</h1>
<i>pppd</i> provides system administrators with sufficient access control that PPP
access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users without
fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it&#146;s
on.  This control is provided through restrictions on which IP
addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated identity (if
any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged user
may use.  Several of pppd&#146;s options are privileged, in particular
those which permit potentially insecure configurations; these options
are only accepted in files which are under the control of the system
administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.
<p>
The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to
use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a
route to that IP address.  For example, a system with a
permanent connection to the wider internet will normally have a
default route, and thus all peers will have to authenticate themselves
in order to set up a connection.  On such a system, the <i>auth</i>
option is the default.  On the other hand, a system where the
PPP link is the only connection to the internet will not normally have
a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address
without authenticating itself.
<p>
As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are privileged,
which means that they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged
user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the
user&#146;s ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the <i>file</i>
option.  Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in
an options file read using the <i>call</i> option.  If pppd is being
run by the root user, privileged options can be used without
restriction.
<p>
When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user&#146;s user ID
or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
specified by the user or the system administrator.  If the device name
comes from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an
options file read using the <i>call</i> option, pppd uses full root
privileges when opening the device.  Thus, by creating an appropriate
file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow users to
establish a ppp connection via a device which they would not normally
have permission to access.  Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user&#146;s
real UID when opening the device.
<h1 class="manpages">AUTHENTICATION</h1>
Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of
its identity.  This involves the first peer sending its name to the
other, together with some kind of secret information which could only
come from the genuine authorized user of that name.  In such an
exchange, we will call the first peer the "client" and the other the
"server".  The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
server, and the server also has a name by which it identifies itself
to the client.  Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or
password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it
knows that secret.  Very often, the names used for authentication
correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not
essential.
<p>
At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication
Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  PAP
involves the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the
server to authenticate itself.  In contrast, the server initiates the
CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the
challenge packet includes the server&#146;s name).  The client must respond
with a response which includes its name plus a hash value derived from
the shared secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows
the secret.  EAP supports CHAP-style authentication, and also includes
the SRP-SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to dictionary-based attacks
and does not require a cleartext password on the server side.
<p>
The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the
other to authenticate itself.  In that case, two separate and
independent authentication exchanges will occur.  The two exchanges
could use different authentication protocols, and in principle,
different names could be used in the two exchanges.
<p>
The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if
requested, and to not require authentication from the peer.  However,
pppd will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol
if it has no secrets which could be used to do so.
<p>
Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets
files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP,
MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and EAP MD5-Challenge, and /etc/ppp/srp-secrets
for EAP SRP-SHA1).
All secrets files have the same format.  The secrets files can
contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other
systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other
systems to itself.
<p>
Each line in a secrets file contains one secret.  A given secret is
specific to a particular combination of client and server - it can
only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that server.
Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3 fields: the name of
the client, the name of the server, and the secret.  These fields may
be followed by a list of the IP addresses that the specified client
may use when connecting to the specified server.
<p>
A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options file, so the
client name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word,
with any embedded spaces or other special characters quoted or
escaped.  Note that case is significant in the client and server names
and in the secret.
<p>
If the secret starts with an &#145;@&#146;, what follows is assumed to be the
name of a file from which to read the secret.  A "*" as the client or
server name matches any name.  When selecting a secret, pppd takes the
best match, i.e.  the match with the fewest wildcards.
<p>
Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of
acceptable IP addresses for that client.  If there are only 3 words on
the line, or if the first word is "-", then all IP addresses are
disallowed.  To allow any address, use "*".  A word starting with "!"
indicates that the specified address is <i>not</i> acceptable.  An
address may be followed by "/" and a number <i>n</i>, to indicate a
whole subnet, i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most
significant <i>n</i> bits.  In this form, the address may be followed
by a plus sign ("+") to indicate that one address from the subnet is
authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use.
In this case, the host part of the address will be set to the unit
number plus one.
<p>
Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in authenticating
other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to
others.  When pppd is authenticating the peer (checking the peer&#146;s
identity), it chooses a secret with the peer&#146;s name in the first
field and the name of the local system in the second field.  The
name of the local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain
name appended if the <i>domain</i> option is used.  This default can be
overridden with the <i>name</i> option, except when the
<i>usehostname</i> option is used.  (For EAP SRP-SHA1, see the
srp-entry(8) utility for generating proper validator entries to be
used in the "secret" field.)
<p>
When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the
peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify
itself to the peer.  This name can be specified by the user with the
<i>user</i> option.  If this option is not used, the name defaults to
the name of the local system, determined as described in the previous
paragraph.  Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first
field and the peer&#146;s name in the second field.  Pppd will know the
name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication is being used, because
the peer will have sent it in the challenge packet.  However, if PAP
is being used, pppd will have to determine the peer&#146;s name from the
options specified by the user.  The user can specify the peer&#146;s name
directly with the <i>remotename</i> option.  Otherwise, if the remote
IP address was specified by a name (rather than in numeric form), that
name will be used as the peer&#146;s name.  Failing that, pppd will use the
null string as the peer&#146;s name.
<p>
When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is first
compared with the secret from the secrets file.  If the password
doesn&#146;t match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and
checked against the secret again.  Thus secrets for authenticating the
peer can be stored in encrypted form if desired.  If the
<i>papcrypt</i> option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is
omitted, for better security.
<p>
Furthermore, if the <i>login</i> option was specified, the username and
password are also checked against the system password database.  Thus,
the system administrator can set up the pap-secrets file to allow PPP
access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses
that each user can use.  Typically, when using the <i>login</i> option,
the secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be "", which will match any
password supplied by the peer.  This avoids the need to have the same
secret in two places.
<p>
Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any
other Network Control Protocol) can be started.  If the peer is
required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will
terminated the link (by closing LCP).  If IPCP negotiates an
unacceptable IP address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed.  IP
packets can only be sent or received when IPCP is open.
<p>
In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can&#146;t
authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a restricted set of
IP addresses, even when the local host generally requires
authentication.  If the peer refuses to authenticate itself when
requested, pppd takes that as equivalent to authenticating with PAP
using the empty string for the username and password.  Thus, by adding
a line to the pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for
the client and password, it is possible to allow restricted access to
hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.
<h1 class="manpages">ROUTING</h1>
<p>
When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the
kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface.
This is sufficient to create a host route to the remote end of the
link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets.
Communication with other machines generally requires further
modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution
Protocol) tables.  In most cases the <i>defaultroute</i> and/or
<i>proxyarp</i> options are sufficient for this, but in some cases
further intervention is required.  The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be
used for this.
<p>
Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the remote
host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the
Internet is through the ppp interface.  The <i>defaultroute</i> option
causes pppd to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and
delete it when the link is terminated.
<p>
In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a
server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to
communicate with the remote host.  The <i>proxyarp</i> option causes
pppd to look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote
host (an interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a
point-to-point or loopback interface).  If found, pppd creates a
permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host
and the hardware address of the network interface found.
<p>
When the <i>demand</i> option is used, the interface IP addresses have
already been set at the point when IPCP comes up.  If pppd has not
been able to negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure
the interface (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic
IP address assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses
to the negotiated addresses.  This may disrupt existing connections,
and the use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic IP address
assignment is not recommended.
<h1 class="manpages">MULTILINK</h1>
Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links
between a pair of machines into a single &#145;bundle&#146;, which appears as a
single virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the
individual links.  Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under
Linux.
<p>
Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same
peer as another link using the peer&#146;s endpoint discriminator and the
authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself).  The
endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique
for each peer.  Several types of data can be used, including
locally-assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses,
randomly strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers.  The endpoint
discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint
option.
<p>
In some circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a
non-unique value.  The bundle option adds an extra string which is
added to the peer&#146;s endpoint discriminator and authenticated identity
when matching up links to be joined together in a bundle.  The bundle
option can also be used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles
between the local system and the peer.  Pppd uses a TDB database in
/var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links.
<p>
Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to
negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first
link to the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to
the peer and create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network
interface unit.  When another pppd is invoked to bring up another link
to the peer, it will detect the existing bundle and join its link to
it.
<p>
If the first link terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a
received LCP terminate-request) the bundle is not destroyed unless
there are no other links remaining in the bundle.  Rather than
exiting, the first pppd keeps running after its link terminates, until
all the links in the bundle have terminated.  If the first pppd
receives a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, it will destroy the bundle and
send a SIGHUP to the pppd processes for each of the links in the
bundle.  If the first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it will terminate
its link but not the bundle.
<p>
Note: demand mode is not currently supported with multilink.
<h1 class="manpages">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>
The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains
the <i>auth</i> option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the
ppp distribution).
<p>
Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.  This
can be done with a command such as

Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.  If
the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the

To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP
address for that user&#146;s machine and create an entry in
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, or /etc/ppp/srp-secrets
(depending on which authentication method the PPP implementation on
the user&#146;s machine supports), so that the user&#146;s machine can
authenticate itself.  For example, if Joe has a machine called
"joespc" that is to be allowed to dial in to the machine called
"server" and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you would add an entry
like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:

<!-- LP ends table -->
</table>
(See srp-entry(8) for a means to generate the server&#146;s entry when
SRP-SHA1 is in use.)
Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example) "ppp",
whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp.
Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in
/etc/ppp/.ppprc.
<p>
If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of
wire, you may need to arrange for some control characters to be
escaped.  In particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and
XOFF (^S), using <i>asyncmap a0000</i>.  If the path includes a telnet,
you probably should escape ^] as well (<i>asyncmap 200a0000</i>).  If
the path includes an rlogin, you will need to use the <i>escape ff</i>
option on the end which is running the rlogin client, since many
rlogin implementations are not transparent; they will remove the
sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the
stream.
<h1 class="manpages">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<p>
Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_DAEMON.
(This can be overridden by recompiling pppd with the macro
LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.)  See the syslog(8)
documentation for details of where the syslog daemon will write the
messages.  On most systems, the syslog daemon uses the
/etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for syslog
messages.  You may need to edit that file to suit.
<p>
The <i>debug</i> option causes the contents of all control packets sent
or received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP packets.
This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or if
authentication fails.
If debugging is enabled at compile time, the <i>debug</i> option also
causes other debugging messages to be logged.
<p>
Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal
to the pppd process.  This signal acts as a toggle.
<h1 class="manpages">EXIT STATUS</h1>

<h1 class="manpages">SCRIPTS</h1>
Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be
used to perform site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are
usually shell scripts, but could be executable code files instead.
Pppd does not wait for the scripts to finish (except for the ip-pre-up
script).  The scripts are
executed as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so
that they can do things such as update routing tables or run
privileged daemons.  Be careful that the contents of these scripts do
not compromise your system&#146;s security.  Pppd runs the scripts with
standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an
environment that is empty except for some environment variables that
give information about the link.  The environment variables that pppd
sets are:

<h1 class="manpages">NOTES</h1>
Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd
process by sending it a signal from the list below.
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>SIGINT, SIGTERM</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP),
restore the serial device settings, and exit.  If a connector or
disconnector process is currently running, pppd will send the same
signal to its process group, so as to terminate the connector or
disconnector process.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>
<b>SIGHUP</b> </td><td valign="bottom">
This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the serial
device settings, and close the serial device.  If the <i>persist</i> or
<i>demand</i> option has been specified, pppd will try to reopen the
serial device and start another connection (after the holdoff period).
Otherwise pppd will exit.  If this signal is received during the
holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately.
If a connector or disconnector process is running, pppd will send the
same signal to its process group.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>SIGUSR1</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
This signal toggles the state of the <i>debug</i> option.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">
<b>SIGUSR2</b> </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression.  This can be
useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result
of a fatal decompression error.  (Fatal decompression errors generally
indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)
