gpg &#151; encryption and signing tool

<tr><td><pre>
<b>gpg</b>  [--homedir <b>name</b>]  [--options <b>file</b>]  [<b>options</b>]  <b>command</b>  [<b>args</b>]   
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>
<b>gpg</b> is the main program for the GnuPG system.
<p>
<p>
This man page only lists the commands and options available.  For more
verbose documentation get the GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH) or one of the
other documents at <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/documentation">http://www.gnupg.org/documentation</a>/ .
<p>
Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non option is
encountered, you can explicitly stop option parsing by using the
special option "--".
<h1 class="manpages">COMMANDS</h1>
<p>
<b>gpg</b> may be run with no commands, in which case it will
perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given
as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified,
a file containing keys is listed).
<p>
<b>gpg</b> recognizes these commands:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-s, --sign [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Make a signature. This command may be combined with --encrypt (for a
signed and encrypted message), --symmetric (for a signed and
symmetrically encrypted message), or --encrypt and --symmetric
together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key
or a passphrase).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--clearsign [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Make a clear text signature.  The content in a clear text signature is
readable without any special software.  OpenPGP software is only
needed to verify the signature.  Clear text signatures may modify
end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not intended
to be reversible.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-b, --detach-sign [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Make a detached signature.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-e, --encrypt [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Encrypt data. This option may be combined with --sign (for a signed
and encrypted message), --symmetric (for a message that may be
decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and --symmetric
together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key
or a passphrase).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-c, --symmetric [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default
symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the
--cipher-algo option.  This option may be combined with --sign (for a
signed and symmetrically encrypted message), --encrypt (for a message
that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and
--encrypt together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a
secret key or a passphrase).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--store [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Store only (make a simple RFC1991 packet).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-d, --decrypt [<b>file</b>]
</td><td>
Decrypt <b>file</b> (or stdin if no file is specified) and
write it to stdout (or the file specified with
--output). If the decrypted file is signed, the
signature is also verified. This command differs
from the default operation, as it never writes to the
filename which is included in the file and it
rejects files which don&#146;t begin with an encrypted
message.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--verify [[<b>sigfile</b>]  [<b>signed-files</b>]]
</td><td>
Assume that <b>sigfile</b> is a signature and verify it
without generating any output.&nbsp;&nbsp;With no arguments,
the signature packet is read from stdin.  If
only a sigfile is given, it may be a complete
signature or a detached signature, in which case
the signed stuff is expected in a file without the
".sig" or ".asc" extension. 
With more than
1 argument, the first should be a detached signature
and the remaining files are the signed stuff.  To read the signed
stuff from stdin, use <b>-</b> as the second filename.
For security reasons a detached signature cannot read the signed
material from stdin without denoting it in the above way.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--multifile
</td><td>
This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for
processing on the command line or read from stdin with each filename
on a separate line.  This allows for many files to be processed at
once.  --multifile may currently be used along with --verify,
--encrypt, and --decrypt.  Note that &#145;--multifile --verify&#146; may not be
used with detached signatures.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--verify-files [<b>files</b>]
</td><td>
Identical to &#145;--multifile --verify&#146;.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--encrypt-files [<b>files</b>]
</td><td>
Identical to &#145;--multifile --encrypt&#146;.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--decrypt-files [<b>files</b>]
</td><td>
Identical to &#145;--multifile --decrypt&#146;.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--list-keys [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--list-public-keys [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the ones given on the
command line.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>

</td><td>
Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or other programs as
it is likely to change as GnuPG changes.  See --with-colons for a
machine-parseable key listing command that is appropriate for use in
scripts and other programs.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
-K, --list-secret-keys [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones given on the
command line.  A &#146;#&#146; after the letters &#146;sec&#146; means that the secret key
is not usable (for example, if it was created via
--export-secret-subkeys).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--list-sigs [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
Same as --list-keys, but the signatures are listed too.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>

</td><td>
For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the
"sig" tag and keyid.  These flags give additional information about
each signature.  From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for
certificate check level (see --ask-cert-level), "L" for a local or
non-exportable signature (see --lsign-key), "R" for a nonRevocable
signature (see the --edit-key command "nrsign"), "P" for a signature
that contains a policy URL (see --cert-policy-url), "N" for a
signature that contains a notation (see --cert-notation), "X" for an
eXpired signature (see --ask-cert-expire), and the numbers 1-9 or "T"
for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels (see the
--edit-key command "tsign").
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--check-sigs [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
Same as --list-sigs, but the signatures are verified.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--fingerprint [<b>names</b>]
</td><td>
List all keys with their fingerprints. This is the
same output as --list-keys but with the additional output
of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined
with --list-sigs or --check-sigs.
If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all
secondary keys are listed too.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--list-packets
</td><td>
List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly
useful for debugging.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--gen-key
</td><td>
Generate a new key pair. This command is normally only used
interactively.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>

</td><td>
There is an experimental feature which allows you to create keys
in batch mode. See the file <b>doc/DETAILS</b> in the source distribution on how to use this.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--edit-key <b>name</b>
</td><td>
Present a menu which enables you to do all key
related tasks:
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
sign
</td><td>
Make a signature on key of user <b>name</b> If the key is not yet
signed by the default user (or the users given with -u), the program
displays the information of the key again, together with its
fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed. This question is
repeated for all users specified with
-u.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
lsign
</td><td>
Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will
therefore never be used by others.  This may be used to make keys
valid only in the local environment.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
nrsign
</td><td>
Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can
therefore never be revoked.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
tsign
</td><td>
Make a trust signature.  This is a signature that combines the notions
of certification (like a regular signature), and trust (like the
"trust" command).  It is generally only useful in distinct communities
or groups.
</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>

</td><td>
Note that "l" (for local / non-exportable), "nr" (for non-revocable,
and "t" (for trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed to "sign" to
create a signature of any type desired.
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
revsig
</td><td>
Revoke a signature.  For every signature which has been generated by
one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate
should be generated.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
trust
</td><td>
Change the owner trust value. This updates the
trust-db immediately and no save is required.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
disable
</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
enable
</td><td>
Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be
used for encryption.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
adduid
</td><td>
Create an alternate user id.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
addphoto
</td><td>
Create a photographic user id.  This will prompt for a JPEG file that
will be embedded into the user ID.  Note that a very large JPEG will
make for a very large key.  Also note that some programs will display
your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in
a dialog box (PGP).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
deluid
</td><td>
Delete a user id.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
delsig
</td><td>
Delete a signature.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
revuid
</td><td>
Revoke a user id.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
addkey
</td><td>
Add a subkey to this key.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
addcardkey
</td><td>
Generate a key on a card and add it 
to this key.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
keytocard
</td><td>
Transfer the selected secret key (or the primary key if no key has
been selected) to a smartcard.  The secret key in the keyring will be
replaced by a stub if the key could be stored successfully on the card
and you use the save command later.  Only certain key types may be
transferred to the card.  A sub menu allows you to select on what card
to store the key.  Note that it is not possible to get that key back
from the card - if the card gets broken your secret key will be lost
unless you have a backup somewhere.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
bkuptocard <b>file</b>
</td><td>
Restore the given file to a card. This command
may be used to restore a backup key (as generated during card
initialization) to a new card.  In almost all cases this will be the
encryption key. You should use this command only
with the corresponding public key and make sure that the file
given as argument is indeed the backup to restore.  You should
then select 2 to restore as encryption key.
You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the backup key and
then for the Admin PIN of the card.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
delkey
</td><td>
Remove a subkey.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
addrevoker [sensitive]
</td><td>
Add a designated revoker.  This takes one optional argument:
"sensitive".  If a designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will
not be exported by default (see
export-options).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
revkey
</td><td>
Revoke a subkey.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
expire
</td><td>
Change the key expiration time.  If a subkey is selected, the
expiration time of this subkey will be changed.  With no selection,
the key expiration of the primary key is changed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
passwd
</td><td>
Change the passphrase of the secret key.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
primary
</td><td>
Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the primary user
id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected
self-signatures one second ahead.  Note that setting a photo user ID
as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a
regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user
IDs.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
uid <b>n</b>
</td><td>
Toggle selection of user id with index <b>n</b>.
Use 0 to deselect all.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
key <b>n</b>
</td><td>
Toggle selection of subkey with index <b>n</b>.
Use 0 to deselect all.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
check
</td><td>
Check all selected user ids.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
showphoto
</td><td>
Display the selected photographic user
id.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
pref
</td><td>
List preferences from the selected user ID.  This shows the actual
preferences, without including any implied preferences.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
showpref
</td><td>
More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID.  This shows
the preferences in effect by including the implied preferences of 3DES
(cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are
not already included in the preference list.  In addition, the
preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
setpref <b>string</b>
</td><td>
Set the list of user ID preferences to <b>string</b> for all (or just
the selected) user IDs.  Calling setpref with no arguments sets the
preference list to the default (either built-in or set via
--default-preference-list), and calling setpref with "none" as the
argument sets an empty preference list.  Use "gpg --version" to get a
list of available algorithms.  Note that while you can change the

--update-trustdb
</td><td>
Do trust database maintenance.  This command iterates over all keys
and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it
may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys.  The user has to
give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed
key to correctly certify (sign) other keys.  GnuPG only asks for the
ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key.  Using the
--edit-key menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.
</td></tr>

--check-trustdb
</td><td>
Do trust database maintenance without user interaction.  From time to
time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or
signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
tracked.  Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do
it automatically unless --no-auto-check-trustdb is set.  This command
can be used to force a trust database check at any time.  The
processing is identical to that of --update-trustdb but it skips keys
with a not yet defined "ownertrust".

<h1 class="manpages">OPTIONS</h1>
<p>
Long options can be put in an options file (default
"~/.gnupg/gpg.conf").  Short option names will not work - for example,
"armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not.  Do
not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any
required arguments.  Lines with a hash (&#146;#&#146;) as the first
non-white-space character are ignored.  Commands may be put in this
file too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute
automatically with every execution of gpg.

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=10%>
--max-output <b>n</b>
</td><td>
This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated
when processing a file.  Since OpenPGP supports various levels of
compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may
be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message.  While
GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to
set a maximum file size that will be generated before processing is
forced to stop by the OS limits.  Defaults to 0, which means "no
limit".

Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical text

--recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will communicate with to
receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.  The format
of the <b>name</b> is a URI: &#145;scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&#146; The
scheme is the type of keyserver: "hkp" for the HTTP (or compatible)
keyservers, "ldap" for the LDAP keyservers, or "mailto" for the Graff
email keyserver.  Note that your particular installation of GnuPG may
have other keyserver types available as well.  Keyserver schemes are
case-insensitive.  After the keyserver name, optional keyserver
configuration options may be provided.  These are the same as the
global --keyserver-options from below, but apply only to this
particular keyserver.

Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no
need to send keys to more than one server.  The keyserver
"hkp://subkeys.pgp.net" uses round robin DNS to give a different
keyserver each time you use it.

include-revoked
</td><td>
When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are
marked on the keyserver as revoked.  Note that not all keyservers
differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such
keyservers this option is meaningless.  Note also that most keyservers

Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible.
Keyserver operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you
a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have
on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and
the time when you verified the signature.

On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the keyserver

multiple actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action.
For example, when retrieving multiple keys via --recv-keys, the
timeout applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to the

"%g" into the fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might
be a subkey), "%p" into the fingerprint of the primary key of the key

significant in low memory situations.  Note, however, that PGP (all

We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have

Don&#146;t use the public key but the session key <b>string</b>.  The format of this
string is the same as the one printed by --show-session-key.  This option
is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the

When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross

This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
Currently defaults to --no-require-cross-certification, but will be
changed to --require-cross-certification in the future.

Don&#146;t look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret

Allow verification of concatenated signed messages.  This will run a

<h1 class="manpages">WARNINGS</h1>
<p>
Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase
to protect your secret key.  This passphrase is the weakest part of the
whole system.  Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring
are very easy to write and so you should protect your "~/.gnupg/"
directory very well.
<p>
Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it
is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase!
<p>
If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line
or use <b>-</b> to specify stdin.
<h1 class="manpages">INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS</h1>
<p>
GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP
standard.  In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts
of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2
compression algorithms.  It is important to be aware that not all
OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by
forcing their use via the --cipher-algo, --digest-algo,
--cert-digest-algo, or --compress-algo options in GnuPG, it is
possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that
cannot be read by the intended recipient.
<p>
There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each
supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms.
For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported
the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm.  A message using BLOWFISH simply could
not be read by a PGP user.  By default, GnuPG uses the standard
OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and
create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which
OpenPGP program they use.  Only override this safe default if you
really know what you are doing.
<p>
If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the
preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far
better off using the --pgp6, --pgp7, or --pgp8 options.  These options
are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in violation
of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a "PGP-safe"
list.
<h1 class="manpages">BUGS</h1>
<p>
On many systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
is necessary to lock memory pages.  Locking memory pages prevents the
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk.  If you get no
warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports
locking without being root.  The program drops root privileges as soon
as locked memory is allocated.
