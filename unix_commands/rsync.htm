<h1 class="manpages">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>
rsync is a program that behaves in much the same way that rcp does,
but has many more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to
greatly speed up file transfers when the destination file is being
updated&#46;
<p>
The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the
differences between two sets of files across the network connection, using
an efficient checksum-search algorithm described in the technical
report that accompanies this package&#46;
<p>
Some of the additional features of rsync are:

<h1 class="manpages">GENERAL</h1>
<p>
Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the
current host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts)&#46;
<p>
There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a
remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contacting an
rsync daemon directly via TCP&#46;  The remote-shell transport is used whenever
the source or destination path contains a single colon (:) separator after
a host specification&#46;  Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the
source or destination path contains a double colon (::) separator after a
host specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the
"USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION" section for
an exception to this latter rule)&#46;
<p>
As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a
destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to "ls -l"&#46;
<p>
As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote
host, the copy occurs locally (see also the <b>--list-only</b> option)&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">SETUP</h1>
<p>
See the file README for installation instructions&#46;
<p>
Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via
a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync
daemon-mode protocol)&#46;  For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh
for its communications, but it may have been configured to use a
different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh&#46;
<p>
You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the <b>-e</b>
command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable&#46;
<p>
Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination
machines&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">USAGE</h1>
<p>
You use rsync in the same way you use rcp&#46; You must specify a source
and a destination, one of which may be remote&#46;
<p>
Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:
<p>
<tt>rsync -t *&#46;c foo:src/</tt>
<p>
This would transfer all files matching the pattern *&#46;c from the
current directory to the directory src on the machine foo&#46; If any of
the files already exist on the remote system then the rsync
remote-update protocol is used to update the file by sending only the
differences&#46; See the tech report for details&#46;
<p>
<tt>rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp</tt>
<p>
This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the
machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine&#46; The
files are transferred in "archive" mode, which ensures that symbolic
links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc&#46; are preserved
in the transfer&#46;  Additionally, compression will be used to reduce the
size of data portions of the transfer&#46;
<p>
<tt>rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp</tt>
<p>
A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating an
additional directory level at the destination&#46;  You can think of a trailing
/ on a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed
to "copy the directory by name", but in both cases the attributes of the
containing directory are transferred to the containing directory on the
destination&#46;  In other words, each of the following commands copies the
files in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of
/dest/foo:
<p>
<tt>rsync -av /src/foo /dest</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo</tt>
<p>
Note also that host and module references don&#146;t require a trailing slash to
copy the contents of the default directory&#46;  For example, both of these
copy the remote directory&#146;s contents into "/dest":
<p>
<tt>rsync -av host: /dest</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>rsync -av host::module /dest</tt>
<p>
You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and
destination don&#146;t have a &#146;:&#146; in the name&#46; In this case it behaves like
an improved copy command&#46;
<p>
Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a
particular rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:
<p>
<tt>rsync somehost&#46;mydomain&#46;com::</tt>
<p>
See the following section for more details&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">ADVANCED USAGE</h1>
<p>
The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host involves using
quoted spaces in the SRC&#46;  Some examples:
<p>
<tt>rsync host::&#146;modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2&#146; /dest</tt>
<p>
This would copy file1 and file2 into /dest from an rsync daemon&#46;  Each
additional arg must include the same "modname/" prefix as the first one,
and must be preceded by a single space&#46;  All other spaces are assumed
to be a part of the filenames&#46;
<p>
<tt>rsync -av host:&#146;dir1/file1 dir2/file2&#146; /dest</tt>
<p>
This would copy file1 and file2 into /dest using a remote shell&#46;  This
word-splitting is done by the remote shell, so if it doesn&#146;t work it means
that the remote shell isn&#146;t configured to split its args based on
whitespace (a very rare setting, but not unknown)&#46;  If you need to transfer
a filename that contains whitespace, you&#146;ll need to either escape the
whitespace in a way that the remote shell will understand, or use wildcards
in place of the spaces&#46;  Two examples of this are:
<p>
<tt>rsync -av host:&#146;file&#92; name&#92; with&#92; spaces&#146; /dest</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>rsync -av host:file?name?with?spaces /dest</tt>
<p>
This latter example assumes that your shell passes through unmatched
wildcards&#46;  If it complains about "no match", put the name in quotes&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON</h1>
<p>
It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the transport&#46;
In this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync daemon, typically
using TCP port 873&#46;  (This obviously requires the daemon to be running on
the remote system, so refer to the STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT
CONNECTIONS section below for information on that&#46;)
<p>
Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell except
that:
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
you either use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to
separate the hostname from the path, or you use an rsync:// URL&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
the first word of the "path" is actually a module name&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
if you specify no path name on the remote daemon then the
list of accessible paths on the daemon will be shown&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
if you specify no local destination then a listing of the
specified files on the remote daemon is provided&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
you must not specify the <b>--rsh</b> (<b>-e</b>) option&#46;
</td></tr>
<!-- PP ends table -->
</table>
An example that copies all the files in a remote module named "src":
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
    rsync -av host::src /dest
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Some modules on the remote daemon may require authentication&#46; If so,
you will receive a password prompt when you connect&#46; You can avoid the
password prompt by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to
the password you want to use or using the <b>--password-file</b> option&#46; This
may be useful when scripting rsync&#46;
<p>
WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all
users&#46; On those systems using <b>--password-file</b> is recommended&#46;
<p>
You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the
environment variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to
your web proxy&#46;  Note that your web proxy&#146;s configuration must support
proxy connections to port 873&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION</h1>
<p>
It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such as
named modules) without actually allowing any new socket connections into a
system (other than what is already required to allow remote-shell access)&#46;
Rsync supports connecting to a host using a remote shell and then spawning
a single-use "daemon" server that expects to read its config file in the
home dir of the remote user&#46;  This can be useful if you want to encrypt a
daemon-style transfer&#146;s data, but since the daemon is started up fresh by
the remote user, you may not be able to use features such as chroot or
change the uid used by the daemon&#46;  (For another way to encrypt a daemon
transfer, consider using ssh to tunnel a local port to a remote machine and
configure a normal rsync daemon on that remote host to only allow
connections from "localhost"&#46;)
<p>
From the user&#146;s perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell
connection uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal
rsync-daemon transfer, with the only exception being that you must
explicitly set the remote shell program on the command-line with the
<b>--rsh=COMMAND</b> option&#46;  (Setting the RSYNC_RSH in the environment
will not turn on this functionality&#46;)  For example:
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
    rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<p>
If you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind that the
user@ prefix in front of the host is specifying the rsync-user value (for a
module that requires user-based authentication)&#46;  This means that you must
give the &#146;-l user&#146; option to ssh when specifying the remote-shell, as in
this example that uses the short version of the <b>--rsh</b> option:
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
    rsync -av -e "ssh -l ssh-user" rsync-user@host::module /dest
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The "ssh-user" will be used at the ssh level; the "rsync-user" will be
used to log-in to the "module"&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS</h1>
<p>
In order to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to have a
daemon already running (or it needs to have configured something like inetd
to spawn an rsync daemon for incoming connections on a particular port)&#46;
For full information on how to start a daemon that will handling incoming
socket connections, see the <b>rsyncd&#46;conf</b>(5) man page -- that is the config
file for the daemon, and it contains the full details for how to run the
daemon (including stand-alone and inetd configurations)&#46;
<p>
If you&#146;re using one of the remote-shell transports for the transfer, there is
no need to manually start an rsync daemon&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>
Here are some examples of how I use rsync&#46;
<p>
To backup my wife&#146;s home directory, which consists of large MS Word
files and mail folders, I use a cron job that runs
<p>
<tt>rsync -Cavz &#46; arvidsjaur:backup</tt>
<p>
each night over a PPP connection to a duplicate directory on my machine
"arvidsjaur"&#46;
<p>
To synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile
targets:
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
    get:
            rsync -avuzb --exclude &#146;*~&#146; samba:samba/ &#46;
    put:

this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the other end of the
connection&#46; I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which saves a
lot of time as the remote CVS protocol isn&#146;t very efficient&#46;

I mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" ftp sites with the
command:
<p>
<tt>rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"</tt>

rsync uses the GNU long options package&#46; Many of the command line
options have two variants, one short and one long&#46;  These are shown
below, separated by commas&#46; Some options only have a long variant&#46;
The &#146;=&#146; for options that take a parameter is optional; whitespace
can be used instead&#46;

<b>--help</b>
</td><td>
Print a short help page describing the options
available in rsync and exit&#46;  For backward-compatibility with older
versions of rsync, the help will also be output if you use the <b>-h</b>
option without any other args&#46;

<b>-v, --verbose</b>
</td><td>
This option increases the amount of information you
are given during the transfer&#46;  By default, rsync works silently&#46; A
single <b>-v</b> will give you information about what files are being
transferred and a brief summary at the end&#46; Two <b>-v</b> flags will give you
information on what files are being skipped and slightly more
information at the end&#46; More than two <b>-v</b> flags should only be used if
you are debugging rsync&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Note that the names of the transferred files that are output are done using
a default <b>--log-format</b> of "%n%L", which tells you just the name of the
file and, if the item is a link, where it points&#46;  At the single <b>-v</b>
level of verbosity, this does not mention when a file gets its attributes
changed&#46;  If you ask for an itemized list of changed attributes (either
<b>--itemize-changes</b> or adding "%i" to the <b>--log-format</b> setting), the
output (on the client) increases to mention all items that are changed in
any way&#46;  See the <b>--log-format</b> option for more details&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-q, --quiet</b>
</td><td>
This option decreases the amount of information you
are given during the transfer, notably suppressing information messages
from the remote server&#46; This flag is useful when invoking rsync from
cron&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-I, --ignore-times</b>
</td><td>
Normally rsync will skip any files that are
already the same size and have the same modification time-stamp&#46;
This option turns off this "quick check" behavior&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--size-only</b>
</td><td>
Normally rsync will not transfer any files that are
already the same size and have the same modification time-stamp&#46; With the
<b>--size-only</b> option, files will not be transferred if they have the same size,
regardless of timestamp&#46; This is useful when starting to use rsync
after using another mirroring system which may not preserve timestamps
exactly&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--modify-window</b>
</td><td>
When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the
timestamps as being equal if they differ by no more than the modify-window
value&#46;  This is normally 0 (for an exact match), but you may find it useful
to set this to a larger value in some situations&#46;  In particular, when
transferring to or from an MS Windows FAT filesystem (which represents
times with a 2-second resolution), <b>--modify-window=1</b> is useful
(allowing times to differ by up to 1 second)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-c, --checksum</b>
</td><td>
This forces the sender to checksum <i>every</i>
regular file using a 128-bit MD4 checksum&#46;  It does this during the initial
file-system scan as it builds the list of all available files&#46; The receiver
then checksums its version of each file (if it exists and it has the same
size as its sender-side counterpart) in order to decide which files need to
be updated: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are
selected for transfer&#46;  Since this whole-file checksumming of all files on
both sides of the connection occurs in addition to the automatic checksum
verifications that occur during a file&#146;s transfer, this option can be quite
slow&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Note that rsync always verifies that each <i>transferred</i> file was correctly
reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its whole-file checksum, but
that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this
option&#146;s before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" check&#46;
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-a, --archive</b>
</td><td>
This is equivalent to <b>-rlptgoD</b>&#46; It is a quick
way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost
everything (with -H being a notable omission)&#46;
The only exception to the above equivalence is when <b>--files-from</b> is
specified, in which case <b>-r</b> is not implied&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Note that <b>-a</b> <b>does not preserve hardlinks</b>, because
finding multiply-linked files is expensive&#46;  You must separately
specify <b>-H</b>&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
--no-OPTION
</td><td>
You may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing
the option name with "no-"&#46;  Not all options may be prefixed with a "no-":
only options that are implied by other options (e&#46;g&#46; <b>--no-D</b>,
<b>--no-perms</b>) or have different defaults in various circumstances
(e&#46;g&#46; <b>--no-whole-file</b>, <b>--no-blocking-io</b>, <b>--no-dirs</b>)&#46;  You may
specify either the short or the long option name after the "no-" prefix
(e&#46;g&#46; <b>--no-R</b> is the same as <b>--no-relative</b>)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
For example: if you want to use <b>-a</b> (<b>--archive</b>) but don&#146;t want
<b>-o</b> (<b>--owner</b>), instead of converting <b>-a</b> into <b>-rlptgD</b>, you
could specify <b>-a --no-o</b> (or <b>-a --no-owner</b>)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
The order of the options is important:  if you specify <b>--no-r -a</b>, the
<b>-r</b> option would end up being turned on, the opposite of <b>-a --no-r</b>&#46;
Note also that the side-effects of the <b>--files-from</b> option are NOT
positional, as it affects the default state of several options and slightly
changes the meaning of <b>-a</b> (see the <b>--files-from</b> option for more
details)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-r, --recursive</b>
</td><td>
This tells rsync to copy directories
recursively&#46;  See also <b>--dirs</b> (<b>-d</b>)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-R, --relative</b>
</td><td>
Use relative paths&#46; This means that the full path
names specified on the command line are sent to the server rather than
just the last parts of the filenames&#46; This is particularly useful when
you want to send several different directories at the same time&#46; For
example, if you used this command:
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -av /foo/bar/baz&#46;c remote:/tmp/</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
&#46;&#46;&#46; this would create a file named baz&#46;c in /tmp/ on the remote
machine&#46; If instead you used
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -avR /foo/bar/baz&#46;c remote:/tmp/</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz&#46;c would be created on the remote
machine -- the full path name is preserved&#46;  To limit the amount of
path information that is sent, you have a couple options:  (1) With
a modern rsync on the sending side (beginning with 2&#46;6&#46;7), you can
insert a dot and a slash into the source path, like this:
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -avR /foo/&#46;/bar/baz&#46;c remote:/tmp/</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
That would create /tmp/bar/baz&#46;c on the remote machine&#46;  (Note that the
dot must be followed by a slash, so "/foo/&#46;" would not be abbreviated&#46;)
(2) For older rsync versions, you would need to use a chdir to limit the
source path&#46;  For example, when pushing files:
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   (cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz&#46;c remote:/tmp/) </tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
(Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell, so that the
"cd" command doesn&#146;t remain in effect for future commands&#46;)
If you&#146;re pulling files, use this idiom (which doesn&#146;t work with an
rsync daemon):
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /foo; rsync" &#92; </tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>       remote:bar/baz&#46;c /tmp/</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--no-implied-dirs</b>
</td><td>
This option affects the default behavior of the
<b>--relative</b> option&#46;  When it is specified, the attributes of the implied
directories from the source names are not included in the transfer&#46;  This
means that the corresponding path elements on the destination system are
left unchanged if they exist, and any missing implied directories are
created with default attributes&#46;  This even allows these implied path
elements to have big differences, such as being a symlink to a directory on
one side of the transfer, and a real directory on the other side&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told rsync to
transfer the file "path/foo/file", the directories "path" and "path/foo"
are implied when <b>--relative</b> is used&#46;  If "path/foo" is a symlink to
"bar" on the destination system, the receiving rsync would ordinarily
delete "path/foo", recreate it as a directory, and receive the file into
the new directory&#46;  With <b>--no-implied-dirs</b>, the receiving rsync updates
"path/foo/file" using the existing path elements, which means that the file
ends up being created in "path/bar"&#46;  Another way to accomplish this link
preservation is to use the <b>--keep-dirlinks</b> option (which will also
affect symlinks to directories in the rest of the transfer)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
In a similar but opposite scenario, if the transfer of "path/foo/file" is
requested and "path/foo" is a symlink on the sending side, running without
<b>--no-implied-dirs</b> would cause rsync to transform "path/foo" on the
receiving side into an identical symlink, and then attempt to transfer
"path/foo/file", which might fail if the duplicated symlink did not point
to a directory on the receiving side&#46;  Another way to avoid this sending of
a symlink as an implied directory is to use <b>--copy-unsafe-links</b>, or
<b>--copy-dirlinks</b> (both of which also affect symlinks in the rest of the
transfer -- see their descriptions for full details)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-b, --backup</b>
</td><td>
With this option, preexisting destination files are
renamed as each file is transferred or deleted&#46;  You can control where the
backup file goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended using the
<b>--backup-dir</b> and <b>--suffix</b> options&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Note that if you don&#146;t specify <b>--backup-dir</b>, (1) the
<b>--omit-dir-times</b> option will be implied, and (2) if <b>--delete</b> is
also in effect (without <b>--delete-excluded</b>), rsync will add a "protect"
filter-rule for the backup suffix to the end of all your existing excludes
(e&#46;g&#46; -f "P *~")&#46;  This will prevent previously backed-up files from being
deleted&#46;  Note that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may
need to manually insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up
in the list so that it has a high enough priority to be effective (e&#46;g&#46;, if
your rules specify a trailing inclusion/exclusion of &#146;*&#146;, the auto-added
rule would never be reached)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--backup-dir=DIR</b>
</td><td>
In combination with the <b>--backup</b> option, this
tells rsync to store all backups in the specified directory&#46; This is
very useful for incremental backups&#46;  You can additionally
specify a backup suffix using the <b>--suffix</b> option
(otherwise the files backed up in the specified directory
will keep their original filenames)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--suffix=SUFFIX</b>
</td><td>
This option allows you to override the default
backup suffix used with the <b>--backup</b> (<b>-b</b>) option&#46; The default suffix is a ~
if no -<b>-backup-dir</b> was specified, otherwise it is an empty string&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>-u, --update</b>
</td><td>
This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on
the destination and have a modified time that is newer than the source
file&#46;  (If an existing destination file has a modify time equal to the
source file&#146;s, it will be updated if the sizes are different&#46;)

This option allows you to choose an alternative

default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
If this option is used with <b>[user@]host::module/path</b>, then the

Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that COMMAND is
presented to rsync as a single argument&#46;  You must use spaces (not tabs
or other whitespace) to separate the command and args from each other,
and you can use single- and/or double-quotes to preserve spaces in an
argument (but not backslashes)&#46;  Note that doubling a single-quote
inside a single-quoted string gives you a single-quote; likewise for
double-quotes (though you need to pay attention to which quotes your
shell is parsing and which quotes rsync is parsing)&#46;  Some examples:

the default remote-shell&#146;s path (e&#46;g&#46; --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync)&#46;
Note that PROGRAM is run with the help of a shell, so it can be any

not corrupt the standard-in & standard-out that rsync is using to
communicate&#46;

Finally, any file is ignored if it is in the same directory as a

If you&#146;re combining <b>-C</b> with your own <b>--filter</b> rules, you should

a lower priority than any rules you specified explicitly&#46;  If you want to
control where these CVS excludes get inserted into your filter rules, you
should omit the <b>-C</b> as a command-line option and use a combination of
<b>--filter=:C</b> and <b>--filter=-C</b> (either on your command-line or by
putting the ":C" and "-C" rules into a filter file with your other rules)&#46;

These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position

The file names that are read from the FILE are all relative to the

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup</tt>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
If /tmp/foo contains the string "bin" (or even "/bin"), the /usr/bin
directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host&#46;  If it
contains "bin/" (note the trailing slash), the immediate contents of
the directory would also be sent (without needing to be explicitly
mentioned in the file -- this began in version 2&#46;6&#46;4)&#46;  In both cases,
if the <b>-r</b> option was enabled, that dir&#146;s entire hierarchy would
also be transferred (keep in mind that <b>-r</b> needs to be specified
explicitly with <b>--files-from</b>, since it is not implied by <b>-a</b>)&#46;
Also note
that the effect of the (enabled by default) <b>--relative</b> option is to
duplicate only the path info that is read from the file -- it does not
force the duplication of the source-spec path (/usr in this case)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
In addition, the <b>--files-from</b> file can be read from the remote host
instead of the local host if you specify a "host:" in front of the file
(the host must match one end of the transfer)&#46;  As a short-cut, you can
specify just a prefix of ":" to mean "use the remote end of the
transfer"&#46;  For example:
</td></tr>

</td><td>
<tt>   rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy</tt>

This tells rsync that the rules/filenames it reads from a

This affects <b>--exclude-from</b>, <b>--include-from</b>, <b>--files-from</b>, and any
merged files specified in a <b>--filter</b> rule&#46;
It does not affect <b>--cvs-exclude</b> (since all names read from a &#46;cvsignore

<b>-T, --temp-dir=DIR</b>
</td><td>
This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a
scratch directory when creating temporary copies of the files transferred
on the receiving side&#46;  The default behavior is to create each temporary
file in the same directory as the associated destination file&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
This option is most often used when the receiving disk partition does not
have enough free space to hold a copy of the largest file in the transfer&#46;
In this case (i&#46;e&#46; when the scratch directory in on a different disk
partition), rsync will not be able to rename each received temporary file
over the top of the associated destination file, but instead must copy it
into place&#46;  Rsync does this by copying the file over the top of the
destination file, which means that the destination file will contain
truncated data during this copy&#46;  If this were not done this way (even if
the destination file were first removed, the data locally copied to a
temporary file in the destination directory, and then renamed into place)
it would be possible for the old file to continue taking up disk space (if
someone had it open), and thus there might not be enough room to fit the
new version on the disk at the same time&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage of disk
space, you may wish to combine it with the <b>--delay-updates</b> option,
which will ensure that all copied files get put into subdirectories in the
destination hierarchy, awaiting the end of the transfer&#46;  If you don&#146;t
have enough room to duplicate all the arriving files on the destination
partition, another way to tell rsync that you aren&#146;t overly concerned
about disk space is to use the <b>--partial-dir</b> option with a relative
path; because this tells rsync that it is OK to stash off a copy of a
single file in a subdir in the destination hierarchy, rsync will use the
partial-dir as a staging area to bring over the copied file, and then
rename it into place from there&#46; (Specifying a <b>--partial-dir</b> with
an absolute path does not have this side-effect&#46;)

<b>--partial</b>
</td><td>
By default, rsync will delete any partially
transferred file if the transfer is interrupted&#46; In some circumstances
it is more desirable to keep partially transferred files&#46; Using the
<b>--partial</b> option tells rsync to keep the partial file which should
make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster&#46;
</td></tr>

</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--partial-dir=DIR</b>
</td><td>
A better way to keep partial files than the
<b>--partial</b> option is to specify a <i>DIR</i> that will be used to hold the
partial data (instead of writing it out to the destination file)&#46;
On the next transfer, rsync will use a file found in this
dir as data to speed up the resumption of the transfer and then delete it
after it has served its purpose&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Note that if <b>--whole-file</b> is specified (or implied), any partial-dir
file that is found for a file that is being updated will simply be removed
(since
rsync is sending files without using the incremental rsync algorithm)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Rsync will create the <i>DIR</i> if it is missing (just the last dir -- not
the whole path)&#46;  This makes it easy to use a relative path (such as
"<b>--partial-dir=&#46;rsync-partial</b>") to have rsync create the
partial-directory in the destination file&#146;s directory when needed, and then
remove it again when the partial file is deleted&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add an exclude
rule at the end of all your existing excludes&#46;  This will prevent the
sending of any partial-dir files that may exist on the sending side, and
will also prevent the untimely deletion of partial-dir items on the
receiving side&#46;  An example: the above <b>--partial-dir</b> option would add
the equivalent of "<b>--exclude=&#46;rsync-partial/</b>" at the end of any other
filter rules&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
If you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add your own
exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because (1) the auto-added
rule may be ineffective at the end of your other rules, or (2) you may wish
to override rsync&#146;s exclude choice&#46;  For instance, if you want to make
rsync clean-up any left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around, you
should specify <b>--delete-after</b> and add a "risk" filter rule, e&#46;g&#46;
<b>-f &#146;R &#46;rsync-partial/&#146;</b>&#46;  (Avoid using <b>--delete-before</b> or
<b>--delete-during</b> unless you don&#146;t need rsync to use any of the
left-over partial-dir data during the current run&#46;)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

IMPORTANT: the <b>--partial-dir</b> should not be writable by other users or it
is a security risk&#46;  E&#46;g&#46; AVOID "/tmp"&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
You can also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment
variable&#46;  Setting this in the environment does not force <b>--partial</b> to be
enabled, but rather it affects where partial files go when <b>--partial</b> is
specified&#46;  For instance, instead of using <b>--partial-dir=&#46;rsync-tmp</b>
along with <b>--progress</b>, you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=&#46;rsync-tmp in your
environment and then just use the <b>-P</b> option to turn on the use of the
&#46;rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers&#46;  The only times that the <b>--partial</b>
option does not look for this environment value are (1) when <b>--inplace</b> was
specified (since <b>--inplace</b> conflicts with <b>--partial-dir</b>), and (2) when
<b>--delay-updates</b> was specified (see below)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
For the purposes of the daemon-config&#146;s "refuse options" setting,
<b>--partial-dir</b> does <i>not</i> imply <b>--partial</b>&#46;  This is so that a
refusal of the <b>--partial</b> option can be used to disallow the overwriting
of destination files with a partial transfer, while still allowing the
safer idiom provided by <b>--partial-dir</b>&#46;
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
<b>--delay-updates</b>
</td><td>
This option puts the temporary file from each
updated file into a holding directory until the end of the
transfer, at which time all the files are renamed into place in rapid
succession&#46;  This attempts to make the updating of the files a little more
atomic&#46;  By default the files are placed into a directory named "&#46;~tmp~" in
each file&#146;s destination directory, but if you&#146;ve specified the
<b>--partial-dir</b> option, that directory will be used instead&#46;  See the
comments in the <b>--partial-dir</b> section for a discussion of how this
"&#46;~tmp~" dir will be excluded from the transfer, and what you can do if
you wnat rsync to cleanup old "&#46;~tmp~" dirs that might be lying around&#46;
Conflicts with <b>--inplace</b> and <b>--append</b>&#46;

<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
This option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit per file
transferred) and also requires enough free disk space on the receiving
side to hold an additional copy of all the updated files&#46;  Note also that
you should not use an absolute path to <b>--partial-dir</b> unless (1)
there is no
chance of any of the files in the transfer having the same name (since all
the updated files will be put into a single directory if the path is
absolute)
and (2) there are no mount points in the hierarchy (since the
delayed updates will fail if they can&#146;t be renamed into place)&#46;

<b>-m, --prune-empty-dirs</b>

This option tells the receiving rsync to get
rid of empty directories from the file-list, including nested directories

creation of a bunch of useless directories when the sending rsync is
recursively scanning a hierarchy of files using include/exclude/filter
rules&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
Because the file-list is actually being pruned, this option also affects
what directories get deleted when a delete is active&#46;  However, keep in

destination files)&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

<b>--list-only</b>
</td><td>
This option will cause the source files to be listed
instead of transferred&#46;  This option is inferred if there is a single source
arg and no destination specified, so its main uses are: (1) to turn a copy
command that includes a
destination arg into a file-listing command, (2) to be able to specify more
than one local source arg (note: be sure to include the destination), or
(3) to avoid the automatically added "<b>-r --exclude=&#146;/*/*&#146;</b>" options that
rsync usually uses as a compatibility kluge when generating a non-recursive
listing&#46;  Caution: keep in mind that a source arg with a wild-card is expanded

Also note that you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to a remote

<h1 class="manpages">FILTER RULES</h1>
<p>
The filter rules allow for flexible selection of which files to transfer
(include) and which files to skip (exclude)&#46;  The rules either directly
specify include/exclude patterns or they specify a way to acquire more
include/exclude patterns (e&#46;g&#46; to read them from a file)&#46;
<p>
As the list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks each
name to be transferred against the list of include/exclude patterns in
turn, and the first matching pattern is acted on:  if it is an exclude
pattern, then that file is skipped; if it is an include pattern then that
filename is not skipped; if no matching pattern is found, then the
filename is not skipped&#46;
<p>
Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the
command-line&#46;  Filter rules have the following syntax:
<p>
<tt>RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>RULE,MODIFIERS [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]</tt>
<p>
You have your choice of using either short or long RULE names, as described
below&#46;  If you use a short-named rule, the &#146;,&#146; separating the RULE from the
MODIFIERS is optional&#46;  The PATTERN or FILENAME that follows (when present)
must come after either a single space or an underscore (_)&#46;
Here are the available rule prefixes:
<p>
<b>exclude, -</b> specifies an exclude pattern&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>include, +</b> specifies an include pattern&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>merge, &#46;</b> specifies a merge-file to read for more rules&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>dir-merge, :</b> specifies a per-directory merge-file&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>hide, H</b> specifies a pattern for hiding files from the transfer&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>show, S</b> files that match the pattern are not hidden&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>protect, P</b> specifies a pattern for protecting files from deletion&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>risk, R</b> files that match the pattern are not protected&#46;
<!-- Need break --><br />
<b>clear, !</b> clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)
<p>
When rules are being read from a file, empty lines are ignored, as are
comment lines that start with a "#"&#46;
<p>
Note that the <b>--include</b>/<b>--exclude</b> command-line options do not allow the
full range of rule parsing as described above -- they only allow the
specification of include/exclude patterns plus a "!" token to clear the
list (and the normal comment parsing when rules are read from a file)&#46;
If a pattern
does not begin with "- " (dash, space) or "+ " (plus, space), then the
rule will be interpreted as if "+ " (for an include option) or "- " (for
an exclude option) were prefixed to the string&#46;  A <b>--filter</b> option, on
the other hand, must always contain either a short or long rule name at the
start of the rule&#46;
<p>
Note also that the <b>--filter</b>, <b>--include</b>, and <b>--exclude</b> options take one
rule/pattern each&#46; To add multiple ones, you can repeat the options on
the command-line, use the merge-file syntax of the <b>--filter</b> option, or
the <b>--include-from</b>/<b>--exclude-from</b> options&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES</h1>
<p>
You can include and exclude files by specifying patterns using the "+",
"-", etc&#46; filter rules (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above)&#46;
The include/exclude rules each specify a pattern that is matched against
the names of the files that are going to be transferred&#46;  These patterns
can take several forms:
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a
particular spot in the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is matched
against the end of the pathname&#46;  This is similar to a leading ^ in
regular expressions&#46;
Thus "/foo" would match a file named "foo" at either the "root of the
transfer" (for a global rule) or in the merge-file&#146;s directory (for a
per-directory rule)&#46;
An unqualified "foo" would match any file or directory named "foo"
anywhere in the tree because the algorithm is applied recursively from
the
top down; it behaves as if each path component gets a turn at being the
end of the file name&#46;  Even the unanchored "sub/foo" would match at
any point in the hierarchy where a "foo" was found within a directory
named "sub"&#46;  See the section on ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS for
a full discussion of how to specify a pattern that matches at the root
of the transfer&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

</td><td>
if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a
directory, not a file, link, or device&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>

rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard
matching by checking if the pattern contains one of these three wildcard
characters: &#146;*&#146;, &#146;?&#146;, and &#146;[&#146; &#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o

a &#146;*&#146; matches any non-empty path component (it stops at slashes)&#46;

if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) or a "**",
then it is matched against the full pathname, including any leading
directories&#46; If the pattern doesn&#146;t contain a / or a "**", then it is
matched only against the final component of the filename&#46;
(Remember that the algorithm is applied recursively so "full filename"
can actually be any portion of a path from the starting directory on
down&#46;)
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o

a trailing "dir_name/***" will match both the directory (as if
"dir_name/" had been specified) and all the files in the directory

version 2&#46;6&#46;7&#46;)
</td></tr>
<!-- Found tag RS -->
<tr><td colspan="2">
Note that, when using the <b>--recursive</b> (<b>-r</b>) option (which is implied by
<b>-a</b>), every subcomponent of every path is visited from the top down, so
include/exclude patterns get applied recursively to each subcomponent&#146;s
full name (e&#46;g&#46; to include "/foo/bar/baz" the subcomponents "/foo" and
"/foo/bar" must not be excluded)&#46;
The exclude patterns actually short-circuit the directory traversal stage
when rsync finds the files to send&#46;  If a pattern excludes a particular
parent directory, it can render a deeper include pattern ineffectual
because rsync did not descend through that excluded section of the
hierarchy&#46;  This is particularly important when using a trailing &#146;*&#146; rule&#46;
For instance, this won&#146;t work:
<p>

This fails because the parent directory "some" is excluded by the &#146;*&#146;
rule, so rsync never visits any of the files in the "some" or "some/path"

to be included by using a single rule: "+ */" (put it somewhere before the
"- *" rule), and perhaps use the <b>--prune-empty-dirs</b> option&#46;  Another
solution is to add specific include rules for all
the parent dirs that need to be visited&#46;  For instance, this set of rules
works fine:

<h1 class="manpages">MERGE-FILE FILTER RULES</h1>
<p>
You can merge whole files into your filter rules by specifying either a
merge (&#46;) or a dir-merge (:) filter rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES
section above)&#46;
<p>
There are two kinds of merged files -- single-instance (&#146;&#46;&#146;) and
per-directory (&#146;:&#146;)&#46;  A single-instance merge file is read one time, and
its rules are incorporated into the filter list in the place of the "&#46;"
rule&#46;  For per-directory merge files, rsync will scan every directory that
it traverses for the named file, merging its contents when the file exists
into the current list of inherited rules&#46;  These per-directory rule files
must be created on the sending side because it is the sending side that is
being scanned for the available files to transfer&#46;  These rule files may
also need to be transferred to the receiving side if you want them to
affect what files don&#146;t get deleted (see PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE
below)&#46;
<p>
Some examples:
<p>
<tt>merge /etc/rsync/default&#46;rules</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>&#46; /etc/rsync/default&#46;rules</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />

Per-directory rules are inherited in all subdirectories of the directory

from its parents, which gives the newest rules a higher priority than the

the spot where the merge-file was specified, so it is possible to override
dir-merge rules via a rule that got specified earlier in the list of global

the directories that are sent as a part of the transfer&#46;  (Note: for an
rsync daemon, the root is always the same as the module&#146;s "path"&#46;)

If you want to include the contents of a "&#46;cvsignore" in your patterns,
you should use the rule ":C", which creates a dir-merge of the &#46;cvsignore
file, but parsed in a CVS-compatible manner&#46;  You can
use this to affect where the <b>--cvs-exclude</b> (<b>-C</b>) option&#146;s inclusion of the
per-directory &#46;cvsignore file gets placed into your rules by putting the
":C" wherever you like in your filter rules&#46;  Without this, rsync would
add the dir-merge rule for the &#46;cvsignore file at the end of all your other
rules (giving it a lower priority than your command-line rules)&#46;  For
example:
<p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td width=6%>&nbsp;</td><td>
<tt>cat &lt;&lt;EOT | rsync -avC --filter=&#146;&#46; -&#146; a/ b</tt>

<tt>rsync -avC --include=foo&#46;o -f :C --exclude=&#146;*&#46;old&#146; a/ b</tt>
</td></tr>
<!-- PP ends table -->
</table>
Both of the above rsync commands are identical&#46;  Each one will merge all
the per-directory &#46;cvsignore rules in the middle of the list rather than
at the end&#46;  This allows their dir-specific rules to supersede the rules
that follow the :C instead of being subservient to all your rules&#46;  To
affect the other CVS exclude rules (i&#46;e&#46; the default list of exclusions,
the contents of $HOME/&#46;cvsignore, and the value of $CVSIGNORE) you should
omit the <b>-C</b> command-line option and instead insert a "-C" rule into
your filter rules; e&#46;g&#46; "--filter=-C"&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">LIST-CLEARING FILTER RULE</h1>
<p>
You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the "!" filter
rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above)&#46;  The "current"
list is either the global list of rules (if the rule is encountered while
parsing the filter options) or a set of per-directory rules (which are
inherited in their own sub-list, so a subdirectory can use this to clear
out the parent&#146;s rules)&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS</h1>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at the
"root of the transfer" (as opposed to per-directory patterns, which are
anchored at the merge-file&#146;s directory)&#46;  If you think of the transfer as
a subtree of names that are being sent from sender to receiver, the
transfer-root is where the tree starts to be duplicated in the destination
directory&#46;  This root governs where patterns that start with a / match&#46;
<p>
Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the
trailing slash on a source path or changing your use of the <b>--relative</b>
option affects the path you need to use in your matching (in addition to
changing how much of the file tree is duplicated on the destination
host)&#46;  The following examples demonstrate this&#46;
<p>
Let&#146;s say that we want to match two source files, one with an absolute
path of "/home/me/foo/bar", and one with a path of "/home/you/bar/baz"&#46;
Here is how the various command choices differ for a 2-source transfer:
<p>
Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /me/foo/bar
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /you/bar/baz
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz
<p>
Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me/ /home/you/ /dest
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /foo/bar               (note missing "me")
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /bar/baz               (note missing "you")
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/foo/bar
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/bar/baz
<p>
Example cmd: rsync -a --relative /home/me/ /home/you /dest
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /home/me/foo/bar       (note full path)
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /home/you/bar/baz      (ditto)
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/home/me/foo/bar
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/home/you/bar/baz
<p>
Example cmd: cd /home; rsync -a --relative me/foo you/ /dest
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /me/foo/bar      (starts at specified path)
<!-- Need break --><br />
+/- pattern: /you/bar/baz     (ditto)
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
<!-- Need break --><br />
Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz
<p>
The easiest way to see what name you should filter is to just
look at the output when using <b>--verbose</b> and put a / in front of the name
(use the <b>--dry-run</b> option if you&#146;re not yet ready to copy any files)&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE</h1>
<p>
Without a delete option, per-directory rules are only relevant on the
sending side, so you can feel free to exclude the merge files themselves
without affecting the transfer&#46;  To make this easy, the &#146;e&#146; modifier adds
this exclude for you, as seen in these two equivalent commands:
<p>
<tt>rsync -av --filter=&#146;: &#46;excl&#146; --exclude=&#46;excl host:src/dir /dest</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>rsync -av --filter=&#146;:e &#46;excl&#146; host:src/dir /dest</tt>
<p>
However, if you want to do a delete on the receiving side AND you want some
files to be excluded from being deleted, you&#146;ll need to be sure that the
receiving side knows what files to exclude&#46;  The easiest way is to include
the per-directory merge files in the transfer and use <b>--delete-after</b>,
because this ensures that the receiving side gets all the same exclude
rules as the sending side before it tries to delete anything:
<p>
<tt>rsync -avF --delete-after host:src/dir /dest</tt>
<p>
However, if the merge files are not a part of the transfer, you&#146;ll need to
either specify some global exclude rules (i&#46;e&#46; specified on the command
line), or you&#146;ll need to maintain your own per-directory merge files on
the receiving side&#46;  An example of the first is this (assume that the
remote &#46;rules files exclude themselves):
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
rsync -av --filter=&#146;: &#46;rules&#146; --filter=&#146;&#46; /my/extra&#46;rules&#146;
   --delete host:src/dir /dest
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In the above example the extra&#46;rules file can affect both sides of the
transfer, but (on the sending side) the rules are subservient to the rules
merged from the &#46;rules files because they were specified after the
per-directory merge rule&#46;
<p>
In one final example, the remote side is excluding the &#46;rsync-filter
files from the transfer, but we want to use our own &#46;rsync-filter files
to control what gets deleted on the receiving side&#46;  To do this we must
specifically exclude the per-directory merge files (so that they don&#146;t get
deleted) and then put rules into the local files to control what else
should not get deleted&#46;  Like one of these commands:
<p>
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr><td><pre>
<p>
    rsync -av --filter=&#146;:e /&#46;rsync-filter&#146; --delete &#92;
        host:src/dir /dest
    rsync -avFF --delete host:src/dir /dest
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">BATCH MODE</h1>
<p>
Batch mode can be used to apply the same set of updates to many
identical systems&#46; Suppose one has a tree which is replicated on a
number of hosts&#46;  Now suppose some changes have been made to this
source tree and those changes need to be propagated to the other
hosts&#46; In order to do this using batch mode, rsync is run with the
write-batch option to apply the changes made to the source tree to one
of the destination trees&#46;  The write-batch option causes the rsync
client to store in a "batch file" all the information needed to repeat
this operation against other, identical destination trees&#46;
<p>
To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync
with the read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch
file, and the destination tree&#46;  Rsync updates the destination tree
using the information stored in the batch file&#46;
<p>
For convenience, one additional file is creating when the write-batch
option is used&#46;  This file&#146;s name is created by appending
"&#46;sh" to the batch filename&#46;  The &#46;sh file contains
a command-line suitable for updating a destination tree using that
batch file&#46; It can be executed using a Bourne (or Bourne-like) shell,
optionally
passing in an alternate destination tree pathname which is then used
instead of the original path&#46; This is useful when the destination tree
path differs from the original destination tree path&#46;
<p>
Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file
status, checksum, and data block generation more than once when
updating multiple destination trees&#46; Multicast transport protocols can
be used to transfer the batch update files in parallel to many hosts
at once, instead of sending the same data to every host individually&#46;
<p>
Examples:
<p>
<tt>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ /adest/dir/</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>$ scp foo* remote:</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>$ ssh remote &#46;/foo&#46;sh /bdest/dir/</tt>
<p>
<tt>$ rsync --write-batch=foo -a /source/dir/ /adest/dir/</tt>
<!-- Need break --><br />
<tt>$ ssh remote rsync --read-batch=- -a /bdest/dir/ &lt;foo</tt>
<p>
In these examples, rsync is used to update /adest/dir/ from /source/dir/
and the information to repeat this operation is stored in "foo" and
"foo&#46;sh"&#46;  The host "remote" is then updated with the batched data going
into the directory /bdest/dir&#46;  The differences between the two examples
reveals some of the flexibility you have in how you deal with batches:
<p>
<table class="src" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<tr><th width="25%">Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
The first example shows that the initial copy doesn&#146;t have to be
local -- you can push or pull data to/from a remote host using either the
remote-shell syntax or rsync daemon syntax, as desired&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
The first example uses the created "foo&#46;sh" file to get the right
rsync options when running the read-batch command on the remote host&#46;
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=6%>
o
</td><td>
The second example reads the batch data via standard input so that
the batch file doesn&#146;t need to be copied to the remote machine first&#46;
This example avoids the foo&#46;sh script because it needed to use a modified
<b>--read-batch</b> option, but you could edit the script file if you wished to
make use of it (just be sure that no other option is trying to use
standard input, such as the "<b>--exclude-from=-</b>" option)&#46;
</td></tr>
<!-- PP ends table -->
</table>
Caveats:
<p>
The read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is updating
to be identical to the destination tree that was used to create the
batch update fileset&#46;  When a difference between the destination trees
is encountered the update might be discarded with a warning (if the file
appears to be up-to-date already) or the file-update may be attempted
and then, if the file fails to verify, the update discarded with an
error&#46;  This means that it should be safe to re-run a read-batch operation
if the command got interrupted&#46;  If you wish to force the batched-update to
always be attempted regardless of the file&#146;s size and date, use the <b>-I</b>
option (when reading the batch)&#46;
If an error occurs, the destination tree will probably be in a
partially updated state&#46; In that case, rsync can
be used in its regular (non-batch) mode of operation to fix up the
destination tree&#46;
<p>
The rsync version used on all destinations must be at least as new as the
one used to generate the batch file&#46;  Rsync will die with an error if the
protocol version in the batch file is too new for the batch-reading rsync
to handle&#46;  See also the <b>--protocol</b> option for a way to have the
creating rsync generate a batch file that an older rsync can understand&#46;
(Note that batch files changed format in version 2&#46;6&#46;3, so mixing versions
older than that with newer versions will not work&#46;)
<p>
When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain options
to match the data in the batch file if you didn&#146;t set them to the same
as the batch-writing command&#46;  Other options can (and should) be changed&#46;
For instance <b>--write-batch</b> changes to <b>--read-batch</b>,
<b>--files-from</b> is dropped, and the
<b>--filter</b>/<b>--include</b>/<b>--exclude</b> options are not needed unless
one of the <b>--delete</b> options is specified&#46;
<p>
The code that creates the BATCH&#46;sh file transforms any filter/include/exclude
options into a single list that is appended as a "here" document to the
shell script file&#46;  An advanced user can use this to modify the exclude
list if a change in what gets deleted by <b>--delete</b> is desired&#46;  A normal
user can ignore this detail and just use the shell script as an easy way
to run the appropriate <b>--read-batch</b> command for the batched data&#46;
<p>
The original batch mode in rsync was based on "rsync+", but the latest
version uses a new implementation&#46;
<p>
<h1 class="manpages">SYMBOLIC LINKS</h1>
<p>
Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic
link in the source directory&#46;
<p>
By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all&#46;  A message
"skipping non-regular" file is emitted for any symlinks that exist&#46;
<p>
If <b>--links</b> is specified, then symlinks are recreated with the same
target on the destination&#46;  Note that <b>--archive</b> implies
<b>--links</b>&#46;
<p>
If <b>--copy-links</b> is specified, then symlinks are "collapsed" by
copying their referent, rather than the symlink&#46;
<p>
rsync also distinguishes "safe" and "unsafe" symbolic links&#46;  An
example where this might be used is a web site mirror that wishes
ensure the rsync module they copy does not include symbolic links to
<b>/etc/passwd</b> in the public section of the site&#46;  Using
<b>--copy-unsafe-links</b> will cause any links to be copied as the file
they point to on the destination&#46;  Using <b>--safe-links</b> will cause
unsafe links to be omitted altogether&#46;  (Note that you must specify
<b>--links</b> for <b>--safe-links</b> to have any effect&#46;)
<p>
Symbolic links are considered unsafe if they are absolute symlinks
(start with <b>/</b>), empty, or if they contain enough <b>"&#46;&#46;"</b>
components to ascend from the directory being copied&#46;
<p>
Here&#146;s a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted&#46;  The list is
in order of precedence, so if your combination of options isn&#146;t mentioned,
use the first line that is a complete subset of your options:

<h1 class="manpages">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>
<p>
rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little
cryptic&#46; The one that seems to cause the most confusion is "protocol
version mismatch -- is your shell clean?"&#46;
<p>
This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell
facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using
for its transport&#46; The way to diagnose this problem is to run your
remote shell like this:
<p>
<tt>ssh remotehost /bin/true &gt; out&#46;dat</tt>
<p>
then look at out&#46;dat&#46; If everything is working correctly then out&#46;dat
should be a zero length file&#46; If you are getting the above error from
rsync then you will probably find that out&#46;dat contains some text or
data&#46; Look at the contents and try to work out what is producing
it&#46; The most common cause is incorrectly configured shell startup
scripts (such as &#46;cshrc or &#46;profile) that contain output statements
for non-interactive logins&#46;
<p>
If you are having trouble debugging filter patterns, then
try specifying the <b>-vv</b> option&#46;  At this level of verbosity rsync will
show why each individual file is included or excluded&#46;
